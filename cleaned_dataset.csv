EDGAR PANGBORN  ""Davy"" Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example, forbids that anyone ""produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms"".  PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  ""A Maze of Death"" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  ""VALIS"" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  ""The Divine Invasion"" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it ""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  ""The Bible"" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.

A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the non-existence of god(s)"").

Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.

Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's ""What Great Men Think of Religion"" and Noyes' ""Views of Religion"". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  ""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  ""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

51060.eml,alt.atheism,"Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.2  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----  An Introduction to Atheism by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>  This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  ""What is atheism?""  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong atheism"".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  ""But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  ""What is agnosticism then?""  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only when referring to ""strong atheism"".  Beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  ""So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  ""But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  ""But what if God is essentially non-detectable?""  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  ""OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?""  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""the redefinition game"".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""Isn't atheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by ""religious"".  ""Religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not ""religion"" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of ""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  ""OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?""  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called ""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  ""If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or ""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be ""anti-religion"".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of ""state atheism"" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  ""But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?""  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  ""What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?""  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  ""You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?""  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""I do not believe in God"" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""Today is not my birthday"".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  ""You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  ""How do atheists differ from religious people?""  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  ""Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable (""wrong"") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:  ""Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.""  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?  A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12% had done so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation; 5% after. [""Freethought Today"", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  ""Is there such a thing as atheist morality?""  If you mean ""Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean ""Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  ""Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?""  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  ""But don't atheists want to believe in God?""  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the ""Big Brother"" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  ""But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!""  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as ""Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  ""Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thing that has a ""meaning"".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking ""What is the meaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?"".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  ""So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  ""Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""  The short answer is ""No, do you?""  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  ""So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?""  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  ""What sort of harm?""  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  ""Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse.""  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  ""Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, ""weak"" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  ""Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct"" it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  ""But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?""  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  ""What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?""  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  ""So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?""  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  ""Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?""  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.  There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.  Be especially sceptical of positive claims.  If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to find it.  Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.  Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.  It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change yourself.  Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.  If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.  Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):  All beliefs should be open to question.

The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.  The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?  One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.

You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.  Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.  But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

Well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.  keith"

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability to commit the same crimes again.

Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.  Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely, however, that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to pretend to have all the answers (and I don't), I would say that the xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing the members of our society.

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only) purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing innocents, is unconscionable.  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society, not their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain.  Why?  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life at all.

However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.  >There is a *probability* of >killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air, and >there is a *probability* of killing an innocent person when the >state administers a system of capital punishment.

Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.  >>And, driving will kill people, as will airlines, but people continue to do >>both. >Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling >prisoners by Courts.

Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.

Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.  >Now there's a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can know, >and if we cannot read minds, we can know nothing.

CRITZ, III"" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  ""Birth Announcement"" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe Information Service ===================================================================  FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT -------------------  (SM) EnviroLeague  A new youth movement,""EnviroLeague,"" was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.  Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:  MISSION  It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members to foster and implement the improved education of young people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible, moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation, improvement, and responsible use of the environment in which we must all live.  OBJECTIVES  In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary objectives shall be: (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many environmentally concerned organizations as possible, said Movement having as its primary focus the education and participatory involvement of young people in appropriate areas of environmental concern; (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and their branches a full complement of program materials for their use, including suitable uniforms, insignia and other badges, written ideas, syllabi and information, literature and other items as shall seem appropriate and desirable; (3)  To serve as a ""clearing house"" for the exchange of program ideas, materials and information among said organizations;  and (4)  To assist environmentally concerned organizations to recruit and train the necessary adult leadership for their youth programs.  EnviroLeague will operate through three ""Program Divisions"" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of ""EnviroLeague Teams,"" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.  EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.  EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.  Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the ""draft"" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.  CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.  The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named ""EnviroLeague."" ============================================================================  Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.

I will argue that your latter statement, ""I believe that no gods exist"" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and ""existence"". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called ""existence"" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that ""god does not exist"", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase ""the existence of God"" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence of God"".  We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what Webster says:  faith 1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion ""based upon observation"", I will have to ask ""what observtions are you refering to?"" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes partents ""believe in God"" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say ""I believe that God does/does not exist"". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the ""existence"" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use ""Him"" because a personal God is the only viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use ""She"" go ahead. Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to.)    And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well thought out discussion.         > Cheers > > Simon > -- > Simon Clippingdale                simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk > Department of Computer Science    Tel (+44) 203 523296 > University of Warwick             FAX (+44) 203 525714 > Coventry CV4 7AL, U.K.  -- bob singleton bobs@thnext.mit.edu"

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.  >>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.

Statements (3) and (4) require belief.  Many atheists (myself included) take the following position:  (5) I do not believe that there is a god. (6) I do not believe that there is not a god.  That is , I harbor no beliefs at all, there is no good evidence for god existing or not.  Some folks call this agnosticism.  It does not suffer from ""blind faith"" at all.

Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.  keith"

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions. Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...  It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.

In the same way, God too is described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know one is metaphorical and not the other.  Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe in God to justify this belief.

How do you know that God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in the bible.  > >>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of > >>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since > >>humanity forsook God's protection.

Adam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians claim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in the billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after them.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't around to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to do with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting here resorting to.

Do you mean by ""omnipotent"" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean ""being all-powerful"" and not ""being able to do anything/everything"".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily ""omnipotent"".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do ""whatever it wanted"". The US would simply ""never want to interfere"" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards,  Jim B."

They consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retort with the old and tired ""they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS"" bullshit.  If I gave you the names what will you do with this information?  Is a fatwa going to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  Do you honestly think that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess?

Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in theory, but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end.  I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims in this regard.  Also, kind of silly.

For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.  If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes.

Without delving into a deep discussion of >creationism vs evolutionism,  Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  >                             God created the original genetic code >perfect and without flaw.

I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.  >Human DNA, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely >affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the >simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in >causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts. I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...  >                                                          Hence >we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial >diseases/disorders.  Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?  >This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you >are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease. >Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of >disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since >humanity forsook God's protection.  Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO. Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials? Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?

Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using ""petty sarcasm"".  So B.M. can have his ""temporary atheists"" whenever he needs them and all the ""temporary atheists"" can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam.

If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest ""imperfection"" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.  On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.  I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting ""theological arguments"" like this. Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.  : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)  : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.  : Actually, neither of us ""knows"" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace ""created"" with ""formed"", since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.  : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed ""degeneration""?  I can understand Scott's reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!! : : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.  Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it to the present.  And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.  : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing ""evil"" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.  : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. : : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are ""meant"" (presumably by God) ""to be : punished by getting diseases"".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?  : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a ""why behind""? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?  : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

Can you reference?  However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:  ""Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth. We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.""  (Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, p. 118).  I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet's cousin and the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating night with a woman.  Selim Guncer  -- Selim E.

As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity. However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner. It is usually presented more in the form, ""And *besides*, I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.""

What justification do you have for this?  No, Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of rehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you, okay?  Jeff."

While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.  Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities. The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker side.  --Andre  -- Andre Yew andrey@cco.caltech.edu (131.215.139.2)"

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width. In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.

This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: --------------------------------------------------- First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.  > There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal > image compression.  Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right?  ""There are always going to be questions until there's a product out there,"" Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.  - Scientific American, March 1990, page 77  Allen B (Don't even get me started :-) )"

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon the version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the 50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory as well).  As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.  It's very fast, but beware of buggy drivers, and otherwise no non-windows support.  -- I am not responsible for anything I do or say -- I'm just an opinion. Robert J.C. Kyanko (rob@rjck.UUCP)"

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA."

38237.eml,comp.graphics,"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.  Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation:   DMPEG V1.0  Public Domain MPEG decoder  by Stefan Eckart   0. Features ===========  DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:   - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)  - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display  - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)  - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale  - color-space selection  - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required  - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)  - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs  ...  4. Technical information ========================  The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas.  ...  -- Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de"

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little >  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing >  program.  I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By ""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.  (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.  (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in other words, will it halt?  Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.  Yeh USC"

Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).   |> |> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading |> companies, |> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4, |> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?   It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.   |>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR |> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?

38259.eml,comp.graphics,"Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:  Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets. No limit to the number of users (apart from performance). Generic clients. Customizable servers. Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources). Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot). Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily attached.  Functionality:  Client: The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users.  The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.  This release of the client software supports the following functionality:  o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)  o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)  o User Interface Panels  o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for faster frame rates)  o Mouse and Keyboard Input  (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)  Server(s): This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers:  o Transparent Client Management  o Client Message Handling  This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.  Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:  o Server Selectable Extension Installation: What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension initialisers you want.  o Event Handler Registration: When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to. (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)  o Collision Detection Registration: If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software. Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.  This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose.  The following is all you need to make a World Server application:  o Provide an initWorld function: This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus any initialization you want to do.  o Provide a positionObject function: This is where you determine where to place a new client.  o Provide an installWorldObjects function: This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.  o Provide a getWorldType function: This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.  o Provide an animateWorld function: This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit (to avoid outrunning the clients).  That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers I've provided:  generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the stairs! Will probably be improved with future versions) dogfight - 72 lines  Location:  This software is located at the following site: ftp.u.washington.edu  Directory: pub/virtual-worlds  File: multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:  Client:  o Texture mapping.  o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading  o HMD support.  o Etc, etc....  Server:  o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).  o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction  o Etc, etc....  Both:  o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!  Finally one major disclaimer:  This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Disclaimer over!

10011.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"I have been posting monthly ""how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC"" posts for a few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.  This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE.  For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at <ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>  Best wishes, Ashok  -- begin SLIP.TXT -- Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring your Modem:  a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W) I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done. These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.  NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.  b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers. There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and batch file examples.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring the SLIP drivers:  There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available CSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver SLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver SLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver) ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP) UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)  Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:  a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a long FTP transfer. c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.  Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE) a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions: For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1 slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all use this virtual driver at 0x60. winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60. pktint.com  Instructions for SLIP8250.COM: a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP. b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver. slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600 c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM pktint.com  Instructions for ETHERSL.COM: If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You will have to DELETE the line ""device=*vcd"" from the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped characters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not recommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as: ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring Windows 3.1:  a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh] section. i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts. COM1Base=03F8 COM1Irq=4 COM2Base=02F8 COM2Irq=3 COM3Base=03E8 COM3Irq=5 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel, but double-clicking on the ""Ports"" icon. ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer COM1Buffer=10000 iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch from one session to another, and this value is at the default value of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash. COM1AutoAssign=0 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel. Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under ""Device Contention"", set the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to ""Never Warn"" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each SLIP session?  I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI each time that I establish a SLIP connection.  If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the configuration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP will not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following:  Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:  [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)  Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file ""attrib +r qvtnet.ini""  Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address that you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the general configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK], and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.  A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation. Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a file called ""myip"".  Another file ""noip"" is essentially a complete QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step ""myip"" and ""noip"" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of Victor's batch file is provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i ""ip=\""%%s\""""  >> myip bootpq -i ""My IP# is: %s"" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip @echo off echo . echo Ready to run WinQVTnet ===================================================== For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)  QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?  PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM  PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:  The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).  [from AUTOEXEC.BAT]  lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net) lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)  Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within Windows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is directed to the file ""popmail.bat"".  This is what popmail.bat reads like:  pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60 exit                    causes the DOS window to close  I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications like PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?  I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows: a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS  I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring compressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session is active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same files.  While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER, for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode  In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the applications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3  When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX, I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads ""IP:incorrect packet type"" or ""IP:bad version number"".  This does not seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on loss of performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?  In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author -- Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him know.  Chances are that he can fix it.  In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2  (C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)  I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate ETHERSL.COM  This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box at a time.  So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library of Medicine).  ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows  If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no problem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PHONE Script Files:  The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than the University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.  Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server, and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP session with the following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"", followed by my password -- again.  Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file - # # CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93 # Last revised 3/28/93 Procedure    Host.CWRU.Login TimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding' Message         ""CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1"" Message         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond' Quiet ON Expect 'Verification' Message         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2' Message         'Sending your user name and password' Quiet OFF Expect   'Username:' Send '%u<' Expect   'Password:' Private Send '%p<' Reject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted' TimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request' Expect 'CWRU-TS2>' Send 'SLIP<' TimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command' Expect 'IP hostname or address:' Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname' Reject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname' Expect 'Password:' Send '%p<' Reject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'

The quick answer -- there is no ""clean"" way.  Below is a batch file hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM, CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory or in your path ...  All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the connection, and unload the driver when you are done ...  -- being CWRUSLIP.BAT -- @echo off rem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

10016,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"I am having something very unusual happen.  First some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week.  Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time.  I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.  Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.  Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in about every 100 files are affected.  I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out.  -- INTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver) UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver NetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115"

10034.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"Hello again,  About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a wide range of comments, each has its own value.  There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well, that's a brief research summary of my personal research.

Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).  I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY was two days.  Good luck!   Craig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com Motorola Communications & Electronics Inc. Glen Rock,  NJ  ===========================================================================  I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality 'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few 'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.  For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as 'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.  >From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.  However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX - something I think?  I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.  ===========================================================================  About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet. The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!  Hope I helped!  (360dpi sure looks great!)

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.  Just my $0.02 worth..  -- Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto P.O. Box 174 Luling, LA 70070 INTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com  ===========================================================================  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to: Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not. I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.  I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at work this month anyway.  Regards  Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling, LA  ===========================================================================  I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:  1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon 2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference 3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.  The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.  As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from - Microsoft?)  Hope this helps. -- Thomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYW tvf@cci.com, ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, tvf@cs.rit.edu Mandlebratwurst: The Meal that Eats Itself!  ===========================================================================  Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-)) I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better, but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in other ""new"" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently available..  > Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 > dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi). > Which is faster?

Which will handle large documents better (75  I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..  Greetz,  Kris  ===========================================================================  When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet. We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by HP.  -Nate  ===========================================================================  Whenever I buy anything I look at what the ""experts"" say, pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.  I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the result.  I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my views/experience:  1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.  2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes they have the expertise.  3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from Windows.  4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!) and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...  5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.  6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty slow with it, God knows what it's like without!  I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily use.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.  Hope this is of use.  Regards  David  ===========================================================================  Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with $50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the DeskJet in print quality.  Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures). I don't print long docs, though.  Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up close; you can see a lot more ""jaggies"" than on a LaserJet. The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page/print head in place, I would imagine.  Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ... manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.  Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.  Know nothing of add-on costs.  Daniel A.

This is in comparison to the other printers I >mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares. > >The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I've not >had any problems with it.  I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.   --- Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications  ===========================================================================  Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be late.  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page.  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.

10035.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is only about as ""fast"" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't what I would call ""fast.""  I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.  Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report, I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend.

Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your machine. The block windows from using those ranges with an EMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever memory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS.

Just go into the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the port to connect the printer to.

My HD was stacked with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with 'funny' names).

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS 6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a number of folks problems.  MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

AT any case, a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to .bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop (shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think, where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I""ll post a corection).   This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you have to rename it.  NOW, another thing.... this is from the windows' FAQ:  your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).  Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file, such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the filename).  ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.  These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory.  Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.   Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

But here's the low-down:  WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a /checkout directory, and creates a ""checkout"" .grp and group if you want to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on exit, if you didn;t like the program.  *HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I ""zip"" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know (as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do, now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the ""run"" cmd) but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only. I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.  Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful ""unzip""ing functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new ver.  (as for now, a good old, ""run-->unzip *.zip"" will work.

10066.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I am getting frustrated and looking for help.  I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.  When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT 2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under 50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell running.  I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at plugging this leak?  2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?  3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.  4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)  5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources?  6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for specifically?

10074.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a Novell administrator's point of view.  I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they (Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the LOCAL setup (described below) as the ""most advantageous installation"". If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.  The LOCAL Windows Installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A. Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.  Advantages: - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main Windows files. - Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time. - Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones. - A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.  Disadvantages: - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. - Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to administer. New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation. - Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations. - Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly. Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and *not* user data.  The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual ""user"" directories.  These directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network ""home"" directory.  The bulk of the Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.  Advantages: - A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. - Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories, the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI. - Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with all driver updates.  Disadvantages: - Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of Windows. - If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work. - Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows files alone. - Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).  The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money.  I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is ""putting all eggs in one basket""; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.  Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to hear from people with ""actual"" working experience with users and network administration."

10078.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:  CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that I type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the DOS prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon screen. ""TELNET"" and ""TN3270"" are the names of batch files in my SLIP directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session.  PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory) to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi- cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to them with more questions.  QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:  1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1 2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation 3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about that.  A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications.  Any information received is appreciated.  Pankaj Saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu"

10083.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"Has anyone observed this?  If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5"") under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.  The corruption is detected by executing ""pkunzip -t b:\file.zip"" after both copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.   Now here's the kicker:   I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps. Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).   So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running, and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app.  When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and 95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = .72 or 72% of the total available CPU time.  When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell (no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task manager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice (assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.  So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy?  It must be!

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I subscribe to an ""outernet"" system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I didn't want in the first place.  If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.  Thanks Ed Klein eklein@spiff.win.net"

Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?) But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus. I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz. The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz. So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz. So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as fast as ISA.  > Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher > cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than > and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a > Diamond SpeedStar 24X?

The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact a video card very much.

Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.

They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what to do.

58838.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.  Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it.  It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)   John   -- John Gayman, WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH"

Kinda fun.  8)  First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2  If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.  > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (""-"" represents jumper) >	W1	1-2 3 >       W2      1-2 3 >	W3	1-2 >	W4	1 2-3 >	W5	1 2 3 >	W6	1-2 3 >	W7	1 2 3  Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.  >The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper)  Looks right.  [art deleted]  >Here are my questions: > >1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?  I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:  5 + +    open 6 + +    open 7 + +    open 8 + +    open 4 + +    closed 3 + +    closed 2 + +    open 1 + +    open  Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).  If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.  >2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?  See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....  >3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?  Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:  -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)  This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.  >Keith Rice  If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using).  -2-    NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry if too techie for ya].   MG>> 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ??  That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask? Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time.  Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'  -rdd  --- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

All you people who are drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like 486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its 486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will). -- Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software"

Try another vendor, I wish I had.  While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM, it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card have evolved to a point of decent performance.

Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother notifying me of fixes/releases.  Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.

Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different TSR programs.  2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.  3.

The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.

If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.  Do not buy a 486SX sytem.  My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.  Gordon"

58986.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"Howdy,  Sorry if this has been covered before:  One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).

Does he have to use new parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part?  When it comes to local dealers:  - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their ""techs"" are re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.  - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.  - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done period, unless you are on a paid service contract.  Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what I'm talking about.  I also know the ""local service"" scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- ""Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service.""  Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point, but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.  - Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)"

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them:  - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address  Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?  I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.  Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Just my 0.02cents thought.... |>   Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to (usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use ""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.  Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois  Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base. As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?  Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.  If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil  Standard disclaimer: The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

Currently I have 8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now, the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so probably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!  V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.

If we are >only talking about a single drive, explain why SCSI is inherently >faster at managing data from a hard drive. You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}: Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.  IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}  SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put."

They may have other patents like this.  Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.  I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.  I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware, and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What other patents does Apple have on the Mac? -- Joe Schwartz       E-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu  or  xor@clotho.acm.rpi.edu MapInfo Corp. 200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.

E15-301 Epistemology and Learning Group, MIT Media Lab     | Cambridge, MA 02139 USA  I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).  If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable setting and switch automatically?

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.

50440.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.  I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu  PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that.

So why is Apple continued development.  Will it > : support the P5 to its fullest capabilities?  Run faster than Windows? It > : must do something significantly better than Windows and OS2 to warrent > : being released.   No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE hardware platform.  As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much for Apple!

I must say that the connections between the power supply and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the last phase (lower Voltage).

The only reason to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet. This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most people and has a great price.

This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily available.

Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.  Victor"

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me ""Why we never received your old chips.""  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied ""You mean you sent them US Mail?"" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to ""make it right.""  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky.

50504.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.  Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next week (heh).  Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them again (grin).  -John Komp@leonardo.src.honeywell.com"

It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.  BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.

I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s. (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,  Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer. ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?  --David +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ | David Blume            | ""I get tired thinking of all the things I  | | dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don't want to do.""  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+"
50527.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:  ""Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?""  Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a ""Semi-Portable"" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got ""quadra"" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor?

X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y"" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object, RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell, etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably, however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena, Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.  Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.  How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct { Visual	*visual; int	depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec	Options;  XtResource resources[] = { {""visual"", ""Visual"", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *), XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL}, {""depth"", ""Depth"", XtRInt, sizeof (int), XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { {""-visual"", ""*visual"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}, {""-depth"", ""*depth"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv) int		argc; char		**argv; { XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ Display		*dpy;		/* display */ char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ Arg		args[10]; Cardinal	cnt; char		*name = ""test""; char		*class = ""Test"";  /* * save the command line arguments */  xargc = argc; xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));  /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */ cnt = 0; top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, (String *) NULL, args, cnt); dpy = XtDisplay (top); cnt = 0; XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources, XtNumber (resources), args, cnt); cnt = 0; if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) { XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could * use a default colormap based on the class of the * visual; we could examine some property on the * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could * do all sorts of things... */ colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy, RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)), Options.visual, AllocNone); XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt;  /* * Now find some information about the visual. */ vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count); if (vinfo_list && count > 0) { XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth); ++cnt; XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); } } XtDestroyWidget (top);   /* * Now create the real toplevel widget. */ XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt; XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt; top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class, applicationShellWidgetClass, dpy, args, cnt);  /* * Display the application and loop handling all events. */ XtRealizeWidget (top); XtAppMainLoop (app); return (0); }  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):   Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top;  for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); }  void ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel;  toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); exit (0); }  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.  This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>  extern Widget ToplevelGet ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw #endif );  extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes XtPointer	closure #endif );  extern void ExitCallback ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget		gw, XtPointer	closure, XtPointer	call_data #endif );  Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget		top;  for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); }   void ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) Widget		gw;		/* widget */ XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ { Widget		toplevel;  toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw), ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL); }  Boolean ExitWorkProc (closure) XtPointer	closure; { exit (0); /*NOTREACHED*/ }   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:  - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while (several thousand times) and then stop until some other event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.  - Pyramid, doesn't work at all.  - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks (get raound it by detecting the situation and having select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification"", Digital Press, 1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). (ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource"" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   ""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality. I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen them so I can't comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor, FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets). Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  __________________________________________ Name		Language	Vendor __________________________________________ Xview		C		Sun OI		C++		ParcPlace Interviews	C++		Stanford Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu __________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) typdef struct { String	name; long	value; } Arg;  and the code: Arg	arg;  XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)  expands to Arg	arg;  arg.name = ""name""; arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \ if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \ XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \ } else { \ XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \ XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \ }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:  string to data type data type to string data type to data type  i) string to data type Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:  Name		Value ""True""		1 ""False""		0  In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark, which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.  If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters.  ii) data type to string This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead, the data type value is simply converted to a string value, probably by the use of sprintf.  Data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.  If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *, XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *); Display *dpy; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; XrmValuePtr fromVal; XrmValuePtr toVal; XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct { unsigned int    size; caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:  #define DONE(var, type) \ if (toVal->addr) \ { \ if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return False; \ } \ else \ *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return True;  #define DONESTR(str) \ if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return False; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, cache, destructor) XtAppContext context; String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, cache, destructor) String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:  XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *); XtAppContext context; XrmValuePtr to; XtPointer converter_data; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:  mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways: 1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays, 2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message, 3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message, server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy) Display		*dpy; { destroyDisplay (dpy); longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () { ... if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.  Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):  1. Args passed at creation time. 2. Command line arguments. 3. User's per host defaults file 4. User's defaults file. 5. User's per application default file. 6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):  %N	The value of the filename parameter, or the application's class name. %T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the literal string ""app-defaults"" %C	customization resource (R5 only) %S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"") %l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"") %t	The territory part of the display's language string %c	The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)  /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this:  myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""  If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:  /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is  <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says:  ""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended.""  you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)  > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to TRUE.  Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency"" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.  > Is this a problem with ""mwm"" or is there something > else which needs to be done?  You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.  > If the problem is ""mwm"", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified?  As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:  ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) if (!ptr) { perror (""malloc in xyzzy()""); exit (1) } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:  if (!ptr) ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); else ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); ++count;  to be written as:  ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:  struct abc *xyzzy; char	     *ptr; char	     *str = ""abcdef"";  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:  char	      *ptr;  ptr = XtMalloc (100); /* ... */ free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).  Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers.  These instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program, including third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging Environment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource ""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:  example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' & example% xwininfo -tree <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:  othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. or this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% gdb application (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 (gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput, XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly. I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens.  The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:  ... cnt = 0; toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, Fallback, args, cnt);  XtAddTimeOut (...) XtAddWorkProc (...)  XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y"" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus?  XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network type graph with automatic layout capability.

The standard strings are either defined as string constants or character pointers into XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement.  At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors). The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly).  In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

The first official release of PEX is with X11R5; fix-22 brings the Sample Implementation server to version 5.1.  The final PEX 5.1 Protocol specification is now available via anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), in the directory /pub/DOCS/PEX/. Changes made from the Public Review draft are listed in the file ""5.1P_changes"" in that directory. [9/92]  The final PEXlib 5.1 document is on export in pub/DOCS/PEXlib. [11/92]  There is now available from the University of Illinois an implementation of the PEX 4.0 specification called UIPEX. It contains a ""near- complete"" implementation of PHiGS and PHiGS PLUS. The file pub/uipex/uipex.tar.Z is on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1); the porting platform was an RT running 4.3.  Questions and comments can to go uipex@cs.uiuc.edu.  In addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?  The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that machine. The distribution all includes ""mftobdf"" which converts PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server. The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?  X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution. In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages). If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.  In addition:  xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in contrib/xproof*. 	[8/90]  Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README: This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates ""Wc - Widget Creation"" resource files and this distribution also includes the Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.  Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G, Kok CH, Ngan TY, ""Druid: A System for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development"". Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM, NY, 1990, pp:167-177.  The BYO interface builder is implemented in tcl.  Also: In addition, these commercial products (unsorted) are available in final or prerelease form [the * following the product name indicates that the product is known to allow the designer to specify for each widget whether a particular resource is hard-coded or written to an application defaults file, for at least one form of output].

I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user is running X.  Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/ area, though they may still be available on various archive sites. In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu package to comp.sources.x (""v08i008: xmenu"") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90] Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91] There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is being worked on and will likely be re-released. xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/ are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92] xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel.tar.Z and may also be found in the alt.sources archives.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  90)  Where can I get an X-based debugger?  xdbx, an X interface to the dbx debugger, is available via ftp from export. The current [1/91] version is 2.1 patchlevel 2. An X interface to gdb called xxgdb is more like xdbx 2.1.2. It is part of comp.sources.x volume 11 [2/91]; xxgdb-1.06.tar.Z is on export. mxgdb is a Motif interface to gdb by Jim Tsillas (jtsillas@bubba.ma30.bull.com); version 1.1.5 was released 1/93. UPS is a source-level debugger which runs under the X11 and SunView window systems on Sun and DEC platforms.

There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines. XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu (128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the electronic classroom. XTV is a conference program which can be used to duplicate the ""chalkboard"" on several displays. Release 1 is available on the X11R5 contrib tapes; a more recent version is on ftp.cs.odu.edu as pub/wahab/XTV.r2.tar.Z. SHX from Michael Altenhofen of Digital Equipment GmbH CEC Karlsruhe also does this; it is a ""WYSIWIS"" (What You See Is What I See) package in the context of a computer-based learning/training tool to provide online help from remote tutors but is also useful for general window sharing. Information: shX@nestvx.enet.dec.com.  SHX can be found on export and gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z, crl.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z Modifications to SHX for color mapping and private color allocation by Mark J.

This FAQ includes information on a number of ""gotchas"" that can bite you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail server. In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?  Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?  If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with libdl.a.  Add ""-ldl"" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to surround it with ""-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic"" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since ""syslibs"" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile the stubs shared.)  [thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?  In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work.  To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:  Patch i.d.      Description 100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu  [Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92]  A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93] contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.  Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.  Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and the server.  This is from the GCC manual:  On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference.  This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.  The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags.  Files which need to be compiled using cc include: server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c rgb/rgb.c  In addition, several of the ""inet_"" functions use structs as args or return values: clients/xhost/xhost.c clients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.  [collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc? When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error ""Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. Fatal server bug! no screens found.""  Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test:  #include <sys/ioctl.h> SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile: #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024) #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN  However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.  Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c  If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you need to run ""ldconfig"" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation. If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).  A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.  [10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?  There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these: 1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site. 2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). 3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?  On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).  [Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 106)  What is Imake?  Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious. There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.  You can obtain information on imake from these sources: - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake. - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of ""send imake-stuff help"" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. - see ""System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?"" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article ""Das Meta-Make / I make, you make / Schwerelos"" by Rainer Klute in ""iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin"", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1. - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake. - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?  Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5. export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?  If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run ""xmkmf"". This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error: Undefined: _XShapeQueryExtension _XShapeCombineMask  These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway.  In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with ""_XtInherit not found"" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error ""ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit"".  What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.  You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. 2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.  It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.  [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X, I get this message: Undefined: _XtScrollBarSetThumb _XtTextSetInsertionPoint _XtTextReplace  There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?  The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called ""hints"" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:  XWMHints wmhints; ... wmhints.flags = InputHint; wmhints.input = True; XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having this done.  If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant. OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?  You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case. For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?  There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to ""test just this one little thing"" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions, and the Xlib ""Hello World"" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]  In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?  The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: { Arg args[3]; int i; int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ i=0; XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++; XtGetValues(widget, args, i ); ... }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable ""sensitive"" as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?  You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted. [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?  Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the ""new"" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget.  Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?  XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?  It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:  void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call) { int             answer; answer = AskUser(w, ""Really Quit?""); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w, ""Are You Really Positive?""); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } }  A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""OK"", ""Cancel"" and ""Help"" or equivalents:  int AskUser(w, string) Widget          w; char           *string; { int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */ Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/ Arg             args[3]; int             n = 0; XtAppContext    context;  n=0; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string, XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer); XtManageChild(dialog);  context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; }  The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices:  void response(w, client, call) Widget          w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.  Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.  If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.  #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:  > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...,window,...);	/* produces error */  The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (""no window"") could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:  display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a ""busy cursor"" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?  The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):  unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes;  /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);  /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0, 65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly, CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?  No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.  Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these ""Xlib sequence lost"" errors?  You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?  It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor. A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A.

You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */ XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); break; ... } }  Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code: ... the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */ the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window, GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values); ...  Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?  The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection. The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen. (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have ""Display"" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note that there is no X notion of a ""transparent color index"". - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the standard colormap, but it doesn't work.  XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.  Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?  Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared]. The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root * Arguments: the display and the screen * Returns: the root window for the client */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, ""__SWM_VROOT"", False); XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren); for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) { Atom            actual_type; int             actual_format; long            nitems, bytesafter; Window         *newRoot = NULL;  if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1, False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems, &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) { root = *newRoot; break; } }  return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?  Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?  It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

There is no easy way.

Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it ""by hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels you name ""opaque"" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.  The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.  But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...  -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy, and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.   -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.  ***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	*** ***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***  Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.  The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it. comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.  In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists: bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions x-ada           X and ada x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics ximage          people interested in image processing and X xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request ""addition request"".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).  A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to openlook-request@unify.com (or openlook-request%unify@uunet.uu.net) for information.

O'Reilly and Associates sponsors a mailing list for the use of X user group organizers; subscribe by sending to listserv@ora.com the message ""subscribe xgroups your@internet.address"".  Local area X user's groups are listed in Issue 4 of O'Reilly's X Resource journal; a list may also be available from xug@ics.com.  The French X User Group is called AFUX and is based in Sophia Antipolis by CERICS. Information can be obtained from Miss Vasseur or Miss Forest; BP 148; 157, rue Albert Einstein; 06561 Valbonne Cedex; Phone: +33 93 95 45 00 / 45 01; Fax: +33 93 95 48 57.  [10/90]  The European X User Group was formed in 1989 to represent X users in Europe.  It holds technical conferences at regular intervals. The EXUG also publishes a regular newsletter which is distributed free of charge to members. The EXUG also runs a email mailing list for members which is frequently used to address issues of European interest in X. The EXUG can be contacted at P.Whitehead@cc.ic.ac.uk, +44 (071) 225 8754, fax +44 (071) 823 9497.  GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (""in preparation"") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?  Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to comp.windows.open-look. Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to comp.windows.x.motif. Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt. Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on maximizing the performance of X. Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems. The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats. The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a section on xmh. The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits. There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?  When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.  Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.  Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?  The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:  - O'Reilly and Associates publishes ""The X Resource: A Practical Journal of the X Window System"" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472). Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.  - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?  Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An ""Xt-based"" program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets. Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets. Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source. Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors. Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5. CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib. XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host. XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources. RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning ""please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual"". UTSL: A common expression meaning ""take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke"". API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library. BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts. GUI: graphical user interface. UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple ""outline"" form WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)  The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either: - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys ""X Window System"" book - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, ""X Protocol Reference Manual."" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete. The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]  - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's ""Programmer's Supplement for Release 5"". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.  Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in ""RTFM"" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?  The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations. Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed. Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?  OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members.  OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a ""virtual toolkit"" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.  OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?  Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?  DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?  PEX is the ""PHiGS Extension to X"". PHiGS stands for ""Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System"" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics. Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is ""low-bandwidth X"" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).  CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or ""proxy"" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem: (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly connected), and (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface, and (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files: XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]  There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?  The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):  wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager. awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality olwm (AT&T): ditto gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available from export. [3/92] tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?  It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?  Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application ""xplaces"" on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database. [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?  DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname: sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?  You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using ""xset r on|off"". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options ""-ar1 350 -ar2 30"" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?  There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do ""macro expansion."" Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, accept a translation resource such as: xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>F1: string(""setenv DISPLAY unix:0"") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special ""remapper"" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

66430.eml,comp.windows.x,"Archive-name: x-faq/part2 Last-modified: 1993/04/04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?  The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]  Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent. xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.  To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.  The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.  Also:  Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.  ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers.  Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include ""print portion of screen"" or ""take a snapshot"" options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.  Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?  If you need color PostScript in particular, you can - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?  This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?  The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).  Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export. Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.  xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.  The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.  The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.  Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.  ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.  xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.  A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar. A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell: echo ""ESC]2;TEXT^G"" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).  Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories: alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'  The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the icon name.  Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.  Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.  [last updated 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?  In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to ""stty pass8"" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell: setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1  For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'.

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give a resource specification like this: xterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly: xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?  You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):  %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the application's class name. %T      The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the literal string ""app-defaults"" %C      customization resource (R5 only) %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults. %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"") %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"") %t      The territory part of the display's language string %c      The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this: myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""  If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is <root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) <root>/%N%C:\     (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line DisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: #!/bin/sh #comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with ""#!/bin/csh"". If this doesn't work, also try starting off with: #!/bin/sh # Reset path: PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?  There are several ways to avoid having to do a ""setenv DISPLAY ..."" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X. One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables. [11/90]  In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host, and you find rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes.

One way is to use the ""bitmap"" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information. The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. An easier way is to use the ""xfed"" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. If you are a MetaFont user you can use ""mftobdf"" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?  After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.) Sometimes your ""xset +fp $dir"" command fails with a BadValue error: X Error of failed request:BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)  This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an ""integer parameter"" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. ""xset +fp ~/myfonts"") and the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file ""fonts.dir"".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're running OpenWindows, look for the file ""Families.list"".  If you can't find it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using. Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work for X11Rn.

A tool called ""snftobdf 1.4"" is part of the bdftools package, which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.

It can be used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91] In addition, the R5 program ""fstobdf"" can produce bdf for any font that the R5 server has access to.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?  The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation, but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font scheme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  43)  How do I add "".bdf"" fonts to my DECwindows server?  The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the "".pcf"" format. You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a performance hit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this: xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave  You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However: A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap.  The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.

This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.  [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?  Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get ""Warning: Widget class version mismatch""?  This error, which typically goes on to say, ""widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003"" indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure. However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?  Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access. [The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in ""pub/webster/NeXT-2.0"".] Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.  However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and non-availability of dictionary servers.

No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not ""public domain"", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee. Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by individual authors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.  [Stephen Gildea, 1/92]  The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?  Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324, phone: 617-258-8330.  You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies.  PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.  Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a guide to the distribution.

66432.eml,comp.windows.x,"(please respond via email!)  Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.  We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.  Any hints?  Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

66433.eml,comp.windows.x,"Archive-name: x-faq/part3 Last-modified: 1993/04/04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?  The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.  Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11.  People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.  Here are a few complications: 1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request ""5a"", ""5b"", ""5c"" and ""5d"" separately 2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris] 3) fix 8 is in two parts: ""8a"" and ""8b"" 4) fix 13 is in three parts: ""13a"", ""13b"", and ""13c"" 5) fix 16 is in two parts: ""16a"" and ""16b"" 6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which previously was optional 7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for ""PEXlib.uu.[1234]"". 8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, ""22a"" through ""22i""  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?  The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request, and it mails back the response. Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the ""Subject:"" header line just like any other line of the message. The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.  1) The command ""help"" or ""send help"" causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file. 2) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""index"", then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example, you can say ""send index fixes"" (or ""index fixes""). A message that requests an index cannot request data. 3) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""send"", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item, you give its directory and its name. For example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest-first. 4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.  The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in ""!"" notation, try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Motif 1.1.2 is also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?  Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5. Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses the ""vanilla"" X11R4 Intrinsics, where ""vanilla"" means ""with just a few patches""; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.  Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are some known new geometry-management problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?  Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape; the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.

[5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications)  The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.  A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93): DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1 MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1  HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5 sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]  User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check that group for posting information.  Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely- available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.  The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or earlier versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area, provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).  These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: sirius.ua.oz.  The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]  A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily (mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies. The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285. A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be: zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies To get a current listing of the files that are available, download the file ""/usrX/ls-lR.Z"". A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the file ""/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX"". The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large amounts of data at one sitting. [courtesy Mark Snitily, 2/90]  In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4"" tapes.  It also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  65)! Where can I get interesting widgets?  The Free Widget Foundation (FWF) library sponsored by Brian Totty (totty@cs.uiuc.edu) is now [2/93] available on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in pub/fwf-v3.41.shar.Z. The set of widgets there is intended to form the basis for future contributions.

Other available file-requestor widgets include the XiFileSelector from Iris Software's book, the xdbx file-selector extracted by David Nedde (daven@wpi.wpi.edu), and the FileNominator from the aXe distribution. The GhostView, Xfig, and vimage packages also include file-selector widgets.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?  Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received user key and mouse input. The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality . At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for use. The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  68)  What is the current state of the world in X terminals?

[Kaleb Keithley, kaleb@thyme.jpl.nasa.gov, 12/91; the file was updated 24 Mar 1993.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  75)  Where can I get an ""X terminal"" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?  Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu [128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it is fairly fast and needs little disk space. A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:  #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in 0)	;; 4)	/etc/reboot -q -n ;; 8)	echo ND fsck failed - get help /etc/halt ;; 12)	echo Interrupted /etc/reboot ;; *)	echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help /etc/halt ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \ `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.  They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.  The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.  The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.  Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!  Mackem Ian."

Because the window manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root window.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including:  X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.  You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.  You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.  Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() regularly."

What I like about GUI's:  - The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files, text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...  - The ability to have several applications / screens visible and accessable at the same time.  - Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:  - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a computer with one hand and use the other for holding something like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting, searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I need to use both hands for is entering text.  I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.  Brent"

I'm unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]  ----------------- Table of Contents ----------------- 0. Introduction & Administrivia 1. What about the ""Other X FAQ""? 2. Window Managers 3.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about them and how to access them, please see the ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" posting in news.answers.  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the command ""send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups"" in the message body.  ----------------------------- What about the ""Other X FAQ""? -----------------------------  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document. Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be: ""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"". (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate for a speedy window manager.  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger, is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"". Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk), Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler. You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try. [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com), Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be), Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of why this works, which I have summarized here:  When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up.  Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""), the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I've experimented with: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 3; exec xterm ) & (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I've even tried: (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had: (sleep 1; exec xclock ) & (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) & (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au), Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs. If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:  In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true  Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:  setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N  [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.]  So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi, and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files with the same name.  This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com), Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov), and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits:  - Easier to maintain / more usable.  - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.  - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:  - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference, and you might consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an application's resource database, you just need to re-run the application without having to ""xrdb"" again.  - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not. WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!  I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted processing the resource file.  The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management.  - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.  - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored, your client will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name.  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY isn't set specially."" Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set. I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment.  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET), Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]  A Better Clock for X - - - - - - - - - - -  1) xcuckoo suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu  Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. Saves screen real estate.  2) mclock suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar  Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources.  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-)  A Better Terminal Emulator for X - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  From the README file distributed with xterm:  +----- |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here | | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +-----  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites. Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com), Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]  1) Xvt suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z  ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog! ""  This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any yet.  UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.  As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets brought into memory.  So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary. If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it. Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs, relative speed of each  2) mterm suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.  ""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""   Tuning your client - - - - - - - - - -  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets:  I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes, particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink. Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.  I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.  [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - - Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file, which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  e.g. (for twm) : menu ""mouse settings"" { ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title ""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &"" ""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &"" ""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &"" ""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &"" }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) : To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of things you can do.  Some that stick out:  - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.  - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.  - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them. (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)  - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE difference.  - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.  Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.  This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps, where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server.  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se): I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action.  The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2 cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com): A lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""Improving X Application Performance"" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in Issue 3 of The X Resource.  An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992 conference proceedings.  This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.  -------------- Author & Notes -------------- This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)  Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is. But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason, he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif, which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.  You cannot say ""A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer"" ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W.  -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+"

66873.eml,comp.windows.x,"...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and action-based, and the other symbol-based.  True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)  I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".  It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not required to do what they do.  To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions; no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this."

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad -- Brad Daniels		`	|  ""If money can't buy happiness, daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess I'll have to rent it.""

Shipping |> to Virginia from Cleveland was around $20 for 12 pounds, and C.O.D. |> was $8.00, as opposed to $4.50 for UPS.  I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:  The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.  For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox operator told me I was not telling the truth about competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them before with NO problems), etc. Right.  A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)  For packages over $100, they charge you about double over what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?) have told horror stories about them...  All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by Mailbox.  Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...  Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!  UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w) SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h) Intergraph Corp.

If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.  2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?    $0.02, doug."

You can rev that car all day, everyday, and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak from expierence!) I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.  NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention, it has an Airbag.

The earlier cars (pre 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.  *************************************************************************** *Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe.  *  MGA 1600 MkII                        * *RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu            *  Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? * *Texas A&M University             *                                       * *Keeper of the eternal octagon    *  `69 MGB Roadster                     * * a.k.a.

I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said ""was something with the heads"", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet.

Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner of a Lemon."

Jacking up the frame some more (had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a 1911A1 ...  A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of torque spec ...  It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack. Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move it back... hmmm...).  After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.  BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for. At least it now sits level..  --  E.

At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.

I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry lost millions.  From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....       -- ******** lmann@jjmhome.uucp (Internet) Laurie.Mann (GEnie) ********* ** Claiming that sex education leads to irresponsible sex is like ** *****  claiming that driver education leads to car accidents.  *****"

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.   -- DON'T DRINK SOAP!

By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

So isn't that saving money?  Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn.  >Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, >then their cars will be even better deals.

Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per- car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.  >Isn't that saving money?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2.  I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.

We changed side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.  Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to reveal the new right mode arrow.  The year after Iceland also changed.  About cars: Before the H-day (H as in ""Hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on the right side. :-)  More contries that uses the left side is:  Japan Tanzania (I think) New Zeeland How about South Africa?  BTW.

I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like ""Do you dare to risk your family in any car?"" attitude, which is quite annoying in the long run.  But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive, 2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine ""CAR"" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And the American magazine ""Road & Track"" said that ""This is not your uncle Olof's car"", and in a positive sense.  But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)  BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)  What? You mean what I drive?

In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.  Good luck."

Go to KMart and buy the > cleaner yourself for $1.29.  This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)  Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however, a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the $59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to do it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Keller	+1 314 537 6317	    The Agricultural Group of Monsanto Company sekell@bb1t.monsanto.com  	KA0WCH		packet: ka0wch@k0pfx.mo.usa.na"

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is ""What is the DoD?"", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be ""How do I get a DoD number?"" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)  Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.  By now you're probably asking ""So who's the KotL already?"". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie mailers""). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head.  ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************  Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).  ***********************************************************************  One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example:  0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM  (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)  Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ""Denizens of Doom"", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)  [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]  There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops, helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They argue with each other and plan rides together.  The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer.  The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers; the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred to as the DoD.  The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""Denizen of Doom.""  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.  The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway and Finland.  Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.  As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's ""Silicon Valley.""  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California ""Joust.""  The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.  Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to get together.  Long may they flame.   ""Live to Flame -- Flame to Live""	[centerbar]  This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as ""flames""; issuing them is called ""flaming.""  Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like:  ""What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad poseur!""  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_  by John Sloan  DoD #0011  Periodically the question ""What is DoD?"" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as ""Why is the sky blue?"", ""If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations.  A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it ""The Denizen of Doom"". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed.  He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number.  Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members.  In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)!  Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell.  The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address.  The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep.  We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection:  Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!!  Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer 11 but what the heck.  Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.  Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor! Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a Woosh-a-stream.  Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.  Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???  Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see what they say, eh?  Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.  High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.  Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!  Terrible: B.T.???  Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.  Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.  Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway???  Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.  Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.  Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.  Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!  Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???  Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean even Villy Ogle flamed me for that!  Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.  Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush!  Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?  Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?  Heritick: Nahhh.  Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.  Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?  Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!  Muck: What's a carbujector?  Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!  Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!  Dill: Well, where do we race?  Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't ride!  Muck: No! No! Quiet!  Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion. They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!  High: My 9 too!  Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!  Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!  Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin!  Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting it up on the ole ventral stand!  Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too!  Booster: I hate Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.  Booster: I love Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.  Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?  Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.  Muck: What about a Tridump?  Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?  Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?  Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?  Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.  Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.  Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.  And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!  Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!  Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.  Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.  More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.  Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.  With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns.  Muck: Why??  Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.  Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.  Clean: No GOOD!  Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!  Clean: Inferior!  Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill...  Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for?  Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME, WILHEM!  Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW?  And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.  All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.  Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?

A lone figure, whom we'll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.]  (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as ""Chuck"". I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.)  Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst, cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir, may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted to live a man's life, [Music slowly builds in background] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys, living the life of a Motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,  I Want to be      A Denizen!  [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.]  Chuck [Sings to the tune of ""The Lumberjack Song""]:  I'm a Denizen and I'm okay, I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay, He flames all night and he rides all day.  I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen...  I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t.  Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He's a Denizen...  I wear high heels And bright pink shorts, full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley, just like my dear mama.  [Chorus refrain]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Why you have to be killed.  Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.  Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?"" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie ""Top Gun"" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied:  ""That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""  And the rest is history.  A variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include:  Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes  Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The rec.moto.photo archive  First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.  Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.  Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive.  **********************************************************  Via ftp:  cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]  Via e-mail:  The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:  dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps  and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.  Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. -- Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner  **********************************************************  A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Patches? What patches?  You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: ""I want!"", or ""That's sick!"", or perhaps ""That's sick! I want!""  Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no ""DoD store"" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says ""I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?"" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action.  Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand].  All ""profits"" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of ""Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World"", complete with a DoD pin.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.  ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT  I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day.  ""Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:  Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way, I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.  Sincerely,   Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395 Director  P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board.""  As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally, it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this amount possible.  Arnie  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Rules, Regulations, & Bylaws of the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club  From time to time there is some mention, discussion, or flame about the rules of the DoD. In order to fan the flames, here is the complete text of the rules governing the DoD.  Rule #1. There are no rules. Rule #0. Go ride.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Other rec.motorcycles information resources.  There are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not have anything to do with the DoD. Most are posted on a regular basis, but they can also be obtained from the cerritos ftp/e-mail server (see the info on the photo archive above).  A general rec.motorcycles FAQ is maintained by Dave Williams. Cerritos filenames are FAQn.TXT, where n is currently 1-5.  The DoD Yellow Pages, a listing of motorcycle industry vendor phone numbers & addresses, is maintained by bob pakser. Cerritos filename is YELLOW_PAGES_Vnn, where n is the rev. number.  The List of the DoD membership is maintained by The Keeper of the List. Cerritos filename is DOD.LIST.  This WitDoD FAQ (surprise, surprise!) is maintained by yours truly. Cerritos filename is DOD_FAQ.TXT.  Additions, corrections, etc. for any of the above should be aimed at the keepers of the respective texts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  (Loki Jorgenson loki@Physics.McGill.CA) has provided an archive site for motorcycle and accessory reviews, here's an excerpt from his periodic announcement.  **********************************************************  The Rec.Motorcycles.Reviews Archives (and World Famous Llama Emporium) contains a Veritable Plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories) reviews, written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences.

Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K  [news.groups]  Approximate DoD Membership: 975  [KotL]  DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. Over $5500  [Arnie]  Organized (?) Rides:  Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]  Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, ""Friend of yours, Steve?"".  ""Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!""  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.   -- Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.com Manes and Associates				   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o"

All the yuppies bought 'the best' a couple  of years ago to pose at the (s)wine bar. They 'rode a mile and walked the rest'. Called a taxi home and went back to the porsche. So there's are loads going cheap with about 1 1/2 miles on the clock (takes a while to coast to a halt).  Cheers  Andy  P.S. You get a better class of people on GS500's anyway"

103140.eml,rec.motorcycles,"OK,  I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally, it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing), but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally, the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)  So, what did I see?  (PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering center today.

This is where I came in.  Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe I need psychological help.

On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you, you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when you were surprised by an oncoming car.

Or should I just work with ""If I drink tonight, I >don't ride until tomorrow""?  This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.  After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than impressed with any of them.  This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.  The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for your self?""  ""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."" He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home.  The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school.

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizen to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Up and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon. The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing your speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an Oakland judge who convicted a speeder ""on the officer's testimony that the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed."" You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you can take it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that way or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't seen _that_ many attempts. You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than it actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you can make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win. I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see some other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd brought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours. Maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time. Besides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota. Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation been more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause."

Yeah, they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost 16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.  Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere $2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)  According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

In fact, >it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.  I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.  >Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first; >about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with >the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score >tied, for another .22.

Say >they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game, >which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will >himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.  The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.    >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough. > >In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?  No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.  >Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What >you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >Does this make sense?   No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team would win.  From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better pitcher?  They were probably about the same.

Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89). On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently.

Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think* Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.  >Winfield has struggled during preseason.

He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is the Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins 1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  If he hits vaguely like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.  Note:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to pick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.

102591.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. ""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging? ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win. ""Lord, I hope we pull it off."" The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play. Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the analysis from Frank Chance. The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies. Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season. Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this division."" The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th! ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams. Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, ""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."" Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save. In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up. Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't afford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked and said: ""Well, maybe Davis will get decked once."" The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella. The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game. ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained. ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered. ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time."" The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough. ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.""  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

102596.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928) = $80,000 x (1.04)^65 = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65 = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t think I'm off by much.

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition, which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.

Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  --	The Beastmaster   -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com"

When he first mentioned it, I thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded.  So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.

Granted, Witt ""might"" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs.  He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best hitter in the majors.  Clay D."

It sounds like you're suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.  >Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, >expected to be among the best ever in baseball.

He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler.

I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo. Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties.

Still, the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year.  Huh?  IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues. In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some increase will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.  > He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his > baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. > That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The > media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a > good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best > hitter in the majors.  I'd put him about there too.  Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. ""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.  Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not. It's got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford  still thinks ""hairy butt is truly ugly"" might be right"

Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games  NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team"" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing  NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2 4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993 5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants 6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink 7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.   NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting what I said in my NL West comment.) ALCS  New York d. Minnesota  World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be fashionable again  NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Kenney                                       kenney@tribe.b17d.ingr.com"

Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.""  >No.  Maybe I need to improve my writing skills.  Lopez, who is very >ordinary defensively, is not likely to hit so well at age 22 >(having not played at AAA level) that it is probably not a good idea >to rush him into the Braves lineup in 1993.  Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.  >>Lopez was hitting .588 over 17 AB when he was cut from spring >>training.  What does he have to do to earn a chance?  Maybe not a full >>time job, but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove >>his worth? > >Gee.  I don't know.  17 abs sounds pretty good to me!  About as good >as your reasoning that the kid should play a back-up role rather >than start every day at AAA.  Talk about *me* as a GM...  The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down ""until he gets warmed up"".  >OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22  Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?  >Most players >benefit, rather than being stagnant or hurt, by playing at AAA.  See above.  >Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their >clubs in the bigs.  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >Braves for this year.  But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.  >Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid >abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out >runners.  And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.  >Not superstars mind you, but solid, experienced veterans.  Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.  >The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the >outfield, an excellent platoon at first, a solid MVP candidate >at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.   >The center >field platoon will probably hit .300.  However good Lopez' >bat *might* be (given the above) it won't be so much better than >what they have to offset the differential in experience and >defensive ability.  Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.  >The kid *will* improve playing at AAA,  Just like Keith Mitchell did?  >I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.

You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.  > Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before >Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They >are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement >since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going >to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't >GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than >they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.  I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.  >I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power.  For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.  >But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)  Well, at least we are in full agreement here!  >This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't  So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>  >getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge >jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne. >They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because >they are winning.  Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne.  I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious to hear your explanation."

52552.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

52555.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"Well, I gotta tell ya,  last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!

He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.  This is good, IMO.

52566,rec.sport.hockey,"Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.  >>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is >>true.

I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.  I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to impale yourself on it :-)  Ciao, Mark S.

However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding.  As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  -- Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253  During the Roman Era, 28 was considered old..."

It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc. John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.  >He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a >new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current >mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was >*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two >fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed >back-ground.

52589.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100  Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.  Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and ""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.  I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).  Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.  With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.  I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.  I just don't want them on mine.     -- Richard J.

52611.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.  Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.  LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.  Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya.  The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.

Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.  Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be like without Recchi for 30 games.  Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.  pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner"
52614.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack.  Injuries:  Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.  Roster Moves:  Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night.  Lines:  Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game Summary:  If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.  The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38  The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.  The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.  Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.  So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.  That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with.  Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

52618.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000. I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the league has already started to move to this direction.  *The Walt Disney Conference* Anaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new LA Kings                      hockey movie LA Flames                   -We've seen some of that San Jose Sharks San Diego Bruins Tijuana Red Wings   -Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry... Dallas Stars Houston Oilers Texas Rangers Seattle Canucks  *The Norm Green Conference* Alabama White Hawks Biloxi Blues Tampa Bay Lightning Miami Blades Helsinki Jets        -You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem Montreal Quebecois (sp?)                 -There will be no 'Canada' Atlanta Devils Orlando Penquins Key West Islanders Hartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move, huh? Palm Beach Capitals  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe the rest of the 'message'.  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards !  I hope I'm just out of my mind. There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim, will there? The Stars aren't REALLY moving..."

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future.  Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.  >    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the >Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up.

I just heard some news, according to which TPS has acquired the next Finnish hockey superstar(??) Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo!  There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen (KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the Finnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL, too.  BTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre, HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year he has reached the top level among Finnish centres.

On the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was in mid-flight, the game completely froze. A couple seconds later, the screen went completely black, with an error message in large ""Bubble"" letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering I am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or Intellevision years ago). Oh yeah, after the message, there was also what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex code that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE???

I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with.  Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was, that play was stopped too often. Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game?

How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of course, there will have to be new ""sub-positions"", like the power center who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him, and the ""shooting defenseman"" and the ""point defenseman"".  Finally, we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.  ;-) ;-) ;-)  -- Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

14147.eml,sci.crypt,"Archive-name: ripem/faq Last-update: Sun, 7 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500  ABOUT THIS POSTING ------------------ This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions and information about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?  RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except the intended recipient.)  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?  RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README file:  #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM.  The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the friend.  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs.  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  (Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real message. (See ""What is DES?"")  Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication, the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender.  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys. This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.  Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:  - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without a direct network connection.  - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with PGP 2.0.)  - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use. PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus, PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:  #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is #contraband.  - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in misc.legal.computing.  (See:  ""DISCLAIMER"")  12)  What about RPEM?  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA. This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is probably key distribution."

It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is ""http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html"".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.  I hope I don't have to edit this again soon. :-)  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one layperson's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.  LIST OF QUESTIONS ----------------- 1)  What is RIPEM? 2)  How can I get RIPEM? 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? 5)  What is RSA? 6)  What is DES? 7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? 8)  What is PEM? 9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? 10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? 13)  What is PGP? 14)  What about RPEM? 15)  What is MIME? 16)  What is TIS/PEM? 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?  RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: ""What is PEM?"")  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?  RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the README file that this law not be violated:  #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM.  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping distribute it.  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs.  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real plaintext. (See ""What is DES?"")  Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.  MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example, RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321.  There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?  This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310, the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section 6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key cryptography.  This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?  RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:  Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (""Diffie-Hellman"")............................... No. 4,200,770  Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (""Hellman-Merkle"").................... No. 4,218,582  Cryptographic Communications System and Method (""RSA"")................................... No. 4,405,829  Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (""Hellman-Pohlig"").................... No. 4,424,414  PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.) PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents.  RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography. However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing code.  RIPEM even won the ""Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992"" award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.  A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:  - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without a direct network connection.  - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself.  - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its patents to ""make, use or sell"" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without either a license or written permission.  (See: ""DISCLAIMER"") (See: ""What about RSADSI/PKP?"")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:  #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency, #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is #contraband.  - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program, which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?  Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH) rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is probably key distribution."
14832.eml,sci.crypt,"Archive-name: ripem/attacks Last-update: 31 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500  SOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM ------------------------------  This is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key, in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key.  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message, since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow an attacker to claim to be you.  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each message has a different DES key, the work for each message would remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office) which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along.  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people. The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is not always practical.  Having other people ""vouch for you"" by signing a statement containing your key is possible, although RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection) to Alice which says ""OK, let's do that."" Your opponent intercepts it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later, figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the unknown message.  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail, although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext, depending how it's stored.  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your passphrase.)  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine, which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between convenience and security here.  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation where other people have access (even root access), but increase security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of course) executable on a floppy disk.  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication.  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work.  Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it."

14984.eml,sci.crypt,"There are many Urban Legends (maybe this ought to be in the Crypt FAQ?) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data.  Here is some information ""from the horse's mouth"".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (NTISS) ""Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines""  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  ""7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction; however, they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media""  [see DoD Computer Security Center, ""Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline"", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,  >Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus >than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will >keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will >simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.  What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.  -- Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de> sig closed for inventory.

14988.eml,sci.crypt,">This thread brings up the more general question.  Can any crypto >implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not >available EVER be trusted?  After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary.  The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can ""break"" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can ""break"" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.

This assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X86 type processor.  It can be negated by NOP'ing the clear debug instruction, or by running the code on a machine simulator, like one I wrote as a senior project in college.  It can bypass and trace practically anything one could write in software.  Kind of like being on a Star Trek Holideck :-).  -- Kenneth Ng Please reply to ken@eies2.njit.edu for now.

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I do not believe that RSA would consent to such.  However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size.  It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.

The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 (as suggested  by Joe Weizenbaum) was invertible.  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated this to me in May 1973.  I then asked an expert (who requested anonymity) what I should use instead; the expert's suggestion was to treat the 8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm, which is similar or identical to DES.  This method or something stronger should take care of (a).  Issue (b) is discussed in comp.security.misc: longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords are the common tactics.  tom_vanvleck@taligent.com"

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.  There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.  -- Joe Keane, amateur cryptologist jgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk)"

Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal ""file system"" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.  The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a ""cluster"" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.  Now you have a situation where no encrypted data ""appears"" on your disk at all :-). -- Ray Berry kb7ht ray@ole.cdac.com  rjberry@eskimo.com  73407.3152@compuserve.com"

A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic hash function (e.g., MD5), when fed with a large amount of more-or-less random data. For example, running MD5 on /dev/mem is a slow, but random enough, source of random bits; there are bound to be 128 bits of entropy in the tens (or hundreds) of megabytes of data in a modern workstation's memory, as a fair amount of them are system timers, i/o buffers, etc.  /ji"

But they can make you piss in a jar, and possibly provide DNA, semen, and hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand.  (BTW, that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking down the door -- the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from explosives.  I found it interesting the news reported his acts, but not his reasons).  Somewhere, perhaps a privacy group, they discussed the legal ramifications of using a password like  I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden  a while back.  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has no bearing on the veracity of that phrase.  You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., ""where did you bury the body?""); you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker.

No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it happens, evidence that will convict you is stored.  The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn over the key.  The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).  Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course, they can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against you.   --Mike      -- Carl Kadie -- I do not represent any organization; this is just me. = kadie@cs.uiuc.edu ="

Helsingius?   * * *   IDENTITY ========  _____ <1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information, for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes.  _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication, privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication', and one classic example of the problems associated with it is H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery.  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance.  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. Many government functions and services are based on identification, and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will literally be magnified exponentially.  _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?  Your email address may contain information that influences people's perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as from a department at a particular university, an employee at a company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name, initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system.  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail.  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist to aid in the quest (see the question on this).  Common Suffixes ---------------  .us    United States .uk    United Kingdom .ca    Canada .fi    Finland .au    Australia  .edu   university or college .com   commercial organization .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization) .gov   government .mil   military site  _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also be able to supply information.  Users with related email address may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally.  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:  finger user@here.there.everywhere  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named.  The response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger utility may return this response in other situations.  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database.  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid user ID's to `crack' passwords.  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.  _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world.  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an individual.  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password, either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address in the From: line.  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From: line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers.  The status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification on the internet:  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail.  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites, and there are delays in the propagation of this data.  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'.  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different interpretations at different sites.  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic is email, comprising  millions of messages.  _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification. However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises in privacy.  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures' and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.   PRIVACY =======  _____ <2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, others may obtain data associated with your account, but not without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want any privacy, some expect and demand it.  _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent. Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation.  _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources.  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even possible.  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can 'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use.  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography.  _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account?  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to others.  This means that they may read any file in your account without detection.  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious' activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons:  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else.  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks.  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users, including anonymous ones.  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on ``X Windows (in)security''.  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically. - Make sure to logout always. - Do not leave a machine unattended for long. - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password. - Avoid password references in email. - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file. - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be considerate.  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords.

The most important privacy considerations are related to file rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory. For a directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.  Examples --------  traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them.  traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights from `group' and `other'.  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example, suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following is possible:  ls foo  These commands would fail independent of file rights:  ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r' readable file named `file':  ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo  The following commands fail:  ls foo ls -l foo   (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server.  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X Windows.  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist.  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted' security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X Hanging Open, Security Terrible.'').  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex.   (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)  _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email?  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message), such as a university.  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally.  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient.  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden.  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email policies.''  _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations. In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring unpopular opinions.)  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to 'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk' annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most commonly associated with the following `abuses':  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism' - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some guidelines:  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy. - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private communication. - Use a disclaimer. - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post). - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be proprietary or `internal'.  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):  /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 --- Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.  /pub/academic/cases --- This is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed description of the items in the directory.  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability --- Notes on university liability for Usenet.  _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?  The public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above.  - You have control over most of this information with the utility `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use `passwd -f').  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering.  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is 'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory.  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you (such as your full name). You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and remailing services that are very recently being established.  See below.  ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are extremely strict.  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using, both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity, which can potentially be misused.  ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).  ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global, international superhighway for data, and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that many people consider completely private (such as their local hard drives) will literally be inches from global network connections. Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet.  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable.  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst, mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years.   ANONYMITY =========  _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity. A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some service and hide all  signs of the association.  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.  _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example, `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social, or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network. Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity.  _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be effective as well, but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet. New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.  _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination. The server `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above.  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer from a regular user account (no root system privileges are required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge. The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system, although actually may be held liable regardless.  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been implemented yet.  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection,.  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them.  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically  network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable  to their own system administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered, regarding it as illicit use.  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user.  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently.  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic, capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting'' before proceeding.  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information. This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators, and similar consequences can ensue.  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.  _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community, and these services should be used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs:  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses. - Others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered. - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common. - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with the use of passwords. - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The field is not likely to improve considerably without  official endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer, e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.  _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy, can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time, highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of Usenet.   * * *  This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous FTP to pit-manager@mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.

Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites become operational. Address all points in the section ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?  With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum (~Dec.1992).  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:  :: command: help  user@host  where `user@host' is your email address.   _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning, especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious, curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.   _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy > must create it for themselves and not expect governments, > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers, > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or > their opinions.  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images, typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually untraceable  communication can take place between sender and receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following commands in the subject line:  subscribe unsubscribe help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ for alt.security.  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First International Symposium on National Security & National Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into > an environment where any information which is at all interesting > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view, > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to query a remote user's login name after connection to a local communication socket (a connection of this type is established during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?   Remailing/Posting -----------------  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted, publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs. - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET postings. - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining, encrypted addresses, etc.) - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and remailer site chaining.  General -------  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the general public and their governments. - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies by systems designers into hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,' `seamlessly,' and `transparently'. - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement agencies. - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single, > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an > electronic frontier. > > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not > so easily fit into existing frameworks.

EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on > structuring the information and communications networks of the > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the > information services industry.  ftp.eff.org ===========  /pub/eff/about-eff --- A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission, achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge, Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal, NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and caller identification.  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.   (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of > jurisdictions.  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine:  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers, > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown, > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. > > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1, > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first > case to challenge the practice. > > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the > special Secret Service school on computer crime. > > ""How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?"" asked Sparks. ""An hour? > > ""Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything > taken? > > ""Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? > > ""Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material > could harm Steve Jackson economically?"" > > Foley replied, ""No, sir,"" but the judge offered his own answer. > > ""You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go > out and hire a lawyer and sue you."" > > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and video transmission applications.  G.

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19): pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to aid remailer use).  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu ----------------------------- Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu ------------------------- Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request information from that address.  hal@alumni.caltech.edu ---------------------- Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return addresses.  Request information from above address.  hh@soda.berkeley.edu hh@cicada.berkeley.edu hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu ---------------------- Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu ---------------------- Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu ----------------------------- Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site address for information.  Notes =====  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues are wholly unresolved.  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP software (see the question on cryptography).  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies) vary between sites.  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?   Users -----  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others. - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others. - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups. - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations. Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic. - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt' hierarchy is preferred. - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e. references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle. - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself. - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege. - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity. - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation. Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead. - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating his hardware, all for your convenience.  Operators ---------  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire? - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your users trust you to protect them. - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g. warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.) - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware. Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under ``(in)stability of anonymity''. - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running? What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is your commitment to it? - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. Consult a lawyer about your liability. - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator, consult those who do and are. - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If possible, query group readers. - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header. - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.  Readers -------  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its volume is heavy or increasing). - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence. - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy, harassment, extortion, etc. - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally. - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself. - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or `conceivable' need exists.  References ----------  See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:  > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a > letter to the editor. The article concludes with a set of > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous.  _____ <8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:  > Try putting this in your kill file: > >   /Anon/h:j >   /Anonymous/h:j > > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't > kill followups.  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.  _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises) but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through servers like there's no tomorrow.''  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge, and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus against it.  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was created.''  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy). Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium, abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial.  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb 1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating through many newsgroups.  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,'' suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors.  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5 hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the service's administration. In response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is currently in the process of code development and testing. He is planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption, etc.  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec. 1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public access account, and he had to shut it down after only several weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the software to the public domain.  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers, and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and encryption.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.  A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   2   ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:  --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;  --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens;  --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and  --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.  ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE     Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?  A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing.  The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."

Quite literally the party is found guilty of holding the court ""in contempt"". Now, the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone there is no question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell, the key is no longer there to be produced.  Obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes (however extenuated) I think that this charge would be a hard nut to make.  Perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up?   -=*=-    -=*=-     -=*=-     -=*=-    -=*=-  Vincent A.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.  A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   2   ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:  --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;  --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens;  --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and  --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?  A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing.  The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products.    -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01"

In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.  > Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government >      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  > A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with >      no new authorities to access the content of the private >      conversations of Americans.

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?  A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing.  The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."

15195.eml,sci.crypt,"April 16, 1993  INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL  The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called ""Clipper Chip"" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.  This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the ""Clipper Chip"" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

15199.eml,sci.crypt,"Note:     The following was released by the White House today in conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip encryption technology.  FACT SHEET  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The President has approved a directive on ""Public Encryption Management.""  The directive provides for the following:  Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access. Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age.  Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As encryption technology improves, doing so will require new, innovative approaches.  In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.  To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:  INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS  The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative, shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.  KEY-ESCROW  The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications.  PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive.  The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase."

15202.eml,sci.crypt,"Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a ""goat"" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.  -- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information, errors and omissions excepted."

However, if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation of the other agent, a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a brute force attack.

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data.  The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation.  To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices.  A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation, and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.

I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.  A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   2   ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:  --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;  --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens;  --   the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and  --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.  ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE     Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?  A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.  Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing.  The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products."
15220.eml,sci.crypt,"This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys to ask for?  Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc., and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number? Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification (the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a Clipper-equipted phone?  Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave relay station).

This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.  And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because ""the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.""

15223.eml,sci.crypt,"I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.  >While encryption >technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the >unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used >by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable equilibrium.

15224.eml,sci.crypt,"Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject in this post), the name ""Clipper Chip"" seems very confusable with the ""Clipper"" chip of Intergraph.  Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations, notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National Semiconductor several years back.  When I first saw ""Clipper Chip"" in the announcement, I immediately thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed ""back door.""  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips.  (It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy is still possible.

There will be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this chip, like it or not.

Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about those two names)  In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed as an ""oh goody"" step upwards.  And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the neighbours with the radios hear right now.

What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.

For example, even with my strong ""right to bear arms"" view of the private right to possess and use strong cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.  If you want more security than it offers, use something different.

The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.

What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state mathematically what this means. Here we go.  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E, and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure. Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong!''  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails, and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.  * Why is the one-time pad secure?  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings) of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive or) of K and P.  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack, i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h, with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus a fortiori A is trivial.)  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad''; this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C. If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1, G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2. In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption P_2.  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks: for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information'' of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within 2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is the probability of key K."

Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????  GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!  If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century. (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).  ---- ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

52735.eml,sci.electronics,"Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth.  Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns off ;-)  Thanks again everyone...  -=-= Wes =-=-"

The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.

This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range.

These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.  Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing the EPROM array to light.

Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least) all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, etc).

Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more battery power.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter. Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced brightness.  Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires in a safe manner!"

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:  0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 0 dBV = 1 volt  0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level) 0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w) SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h) Intergraph Corp.

If you could find the specs this might just work for you...  I believe that the ""A-D converters"" found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab measurements off something as non-linear as that.  Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher voltages would be more precise).  On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...  ---Joel Kolstad"

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

52786.eml,sci.electronics,"Hi,  I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v). The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v. Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v. If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)? Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion, in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their 54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w) SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h) Intergraph Corp.

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.      -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------     ----------------------------------------------------------------------"

52794.eml,sci.electronics,"Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are - What do the radar detector detectors actually detect? Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector antenna?

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.  This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.

This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car.

52806.eml,sci.electronics,"I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device? (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

The most common method of implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great care.

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like ""Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.""  >You wanted >to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a >thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,  More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.  >and now you want >all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal >hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal.  It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  >You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to >get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself >to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other ""just in case"" measures >you think are necessary.  My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.  >But I for one am bothered by your continued >suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first >time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these >unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing >it naturally.

But for heaven's sake, not everyone needs that!  But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration. -- Mark A.

As I understand, these are all short term.  I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.  I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context.

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there.  -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      ""...dammit, not a programmer!  = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-="

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile. Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?

It eventually becomes unconscious.

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for ""life events"" in any recent version of Adiposity 101).

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help. Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies), yawning--these will help all four causes.   -- Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA ""A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all.""

I do realize that since this is a relatively new >disorder (first documented in 1974 in a fertility clinic in Scandanavia) >and is therefore ""controversial"".  I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with ""Kartagener's syndrome"", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. ""Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be ""random."" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).  According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of which there is probably one at NCSU.  -km"

What is the mechanism and why would a physician >call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing?  Purists often distinguish between ""true"" clubbing and ""pseudo"" clubbing, the difference being that with ""true"" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With ""pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. ""Real"" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only ""true"" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.  The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.  Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.  -km"

The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the ""meningococcus"", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.  This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.  Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.   -km"

I've seen at least three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic damage, including paraplegia.

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.

58109.eml,sci.med,"I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only ""real solution"" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the ""internal nerves"" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that ""force"" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.  Janice Rathmann"

Very little acne as a teenager. I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.  Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.  Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).   -Jackie-"

58112.eml,sci.med,"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful experience:  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear that these things will itch for months.  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters, since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is required to get it.  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well. A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried. Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think it gains nothing).  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money. -- Gary H.

The odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim.

Make sure to >tell the pharmacist that you want the ""Physicians' Package Insert"" *NOT* the  If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to ""go ballistic"", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | ""Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.

59848.eml,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/controversy Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:06 $  CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS  These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being offered. The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set public policy, that's what your representatives are for.   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS  Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm.  The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from.  By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design.   WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE  Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early in a mission.   RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES  There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small. Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].  To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to pursue are:  A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch, ""Showdown at Pad 39-B,"" by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November 1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800; Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)   IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER  From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study, Charles Jackman.  The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.  The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:  Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year  The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the total stratospheric chlorine sources.  The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.  The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time.  Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE  If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.  Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).  _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W. Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.   HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED  The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example. What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin team's medical/forensic report.  The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team examined them, they were sent off to be buried.   USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT  You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.  Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft.  [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]   THE ""FACE ON MARS""  There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery: 35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13 (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).  Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't know the address) to study the Face.  The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or sci.astro.  V. DiPeitro and G.

59850.eml,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $  HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT  First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA announcement.  Q. How do I become an astronaut?  A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission specialist"".  If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that, the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people, but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason, many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.  Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore- seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner.  Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical, you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.  Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie. Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point, and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent. Keep your nose clean.  Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby; experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.  Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988, 43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut). If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".  Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation.  Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.     NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Houston, Texas  Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates ==================================================================  Astronaut Candidate Program ---------------------------  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.  Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered.  All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation program.  Space Shuttle Program Description ---------------------------------  The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew.  The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries.  The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot, and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA astronauts.  Pilot Astronaut  Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots. During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle, crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other payload operations.  Mission Specialist Astronaut  Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot, have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific experimental operations.  Astronaut Candidate Program ===========================  Basic Qualification Requirements --------------------------------  Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application.  Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:  1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic preparation is important.  2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following specific standards:  Distant visual acuity: 20/150 or better uncorrected, correctable to 20/20, each eye.  Blood pressure: 140/90 measured in sitting position.  3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.  Pilot Astronaut Candidate:  1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of academic preparation is important.  2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight test experience highly desirable.  3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following specific standards:  Distant visual acuity: 20/50 or better uncorrected correctable to 20/20, each eye.  Blood pressure: 140/90 measured in sitting position.  4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.  Citizenship Requirements  Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of the United States.  Note on Academic Requirements  Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions -- specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics.  The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the sciences, are not considered qualifying: - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, Medical Technology, etc.) - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying). - Degrees in Nursing. - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.) - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.  Application Procedures ----------------------  Civilian  The application package may be obtained by writing to:  NASA Johnson Space Center Astronaut Selection Office ATTN: AHX Houston, TX 77058  Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made. Applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted.  Active Duty Military  Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application procedures will be disseminated by each service.  Selection ---------  Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration. Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process.  Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment.  General Program Requirements  Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during their candidate period.  Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a specified tour of duty.  NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates. Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.  Pay and Benefits ----------------  Civilians  Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14, and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience.  Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and participation in group health and life insurance plans.  Military  Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and other similar military matters.

59871,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO  INTRODUCTION  This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).  If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).  The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.  Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.  Questions fall into three basic types:  1) Where do I find some information about space?  Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended discussion.  2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?  Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.  3) Miscellanous queries.  These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of FAQ postings.   SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE  Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet. Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?] Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent. Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth 100 posts). Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST not SPACE. Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all references.) Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize! Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the 'reply' function of mailers will work. Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone will get on TV anyway. Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals (use carriage returns).

59872,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/net Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $  NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent between these networks, and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers'.  The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.  One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below.  A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro', and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called 'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted.  Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS  SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the International Space University (in only its second change of management in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README for further details.  Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.  GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.  Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.  Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics; discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech, or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.  SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and other interested parties. Email LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.  SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join. Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.  Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him to join the list.  As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate 'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION  In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the individuals posting this information are performing a service for all net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

WARNING ABOUT NON-PUBLIC NETWORKS  (Included at the suggestion of Eugene Miya, who wrote the item)  NASA has an internal system of unclassified electronic mail and bulletin boards. This system is not open for public use. Specifically, NASA personnel and procurement operations are regarded with some sensitivity. Contractors must renegotiate their contracts. The Fair and Open Procurement Act does not look kindly to those having inside information. Contractors and outsiders caught using this type of information can expect severe penalities. Unauthorized access attempts may subject you to a fine and/or imprisonment in accordance with Title 18, USC, Section 1030. If in fact you should should learn of unauthorized access, contact NASA personnel.  Claims have been made on this news group about fraud and waste. None have ever been substantiated to any significant degree. Readers detecting Fraud, Waste, Abuse, or Mismanagement should contact the NASA Inspector General (24-hours) at 800-424-9183 (can be anonymous) or write  NASA Inspector General P.O.

59873,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/data Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $  ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.   INTRODUCTION  A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net. A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions on how to make requests.  The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.  Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES  The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X, use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP sites.  The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES  NASA AMES  Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.  FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the archive (the index is about 200K by itself).  To access the archives by email, send a letter to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:  send SPACE Index send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.  The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this section for images or programs.  The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are available in these collections.  The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).  The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.  Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).   NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM  The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140 data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition, ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors, keywords, title words, or abstract text words.  ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).  Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).   NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)  pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions. It may also be reached by modem at (818)-354-1333 (no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit).  Contact newsdesk@jplpost.jpl.nasa.gov or phone (818)-354-7170.   NASA LANGLEY (TECHNICAL REPORTS)  techreports.larc.nasa.gov is an anonymous FTP site offering technical reports. To get started, cd to directory pub/techreports/larc/92 and retrieve files README and abstracts.92. Most files are compressed PostScript. The reports are also in a WAIS database with the following description:  (:source :version 3 :ip-name ""techreports.larc.nasa.gov"" :tcp-port 210 :database-name ""nasa-larc-abs"" :cost 0.00 :cost-unit :free :maintainer ""M.L.Nelson@LaRC.NASA.GOV"" :description ""NASA Langley Research Center Technical Reports  Contact tr-admin@techreports.larc.nasa.gov.   NASA SPACELINK  SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop between the user and NASA.  SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.  You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.  Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in directory SPACELINK.   NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)  The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online. Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and carriage return.

Contact: Benoit Pirenne, bpirenne@eso.org (phone +49 89 320 06 433) at ST-ECF   ASTRONOMICAL DATABASES  The full SAO stellar database is *NOT* available online, probably due to the 40 MB size. It may be ordered on magnetic tape from the NSSDC. A subset containing position and magnitude only is available by FTP (see ""Astronomy Programs"" below).  nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. This site is mainly for European users, but overseas connections are possible.  The Ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name, RA, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in MISC/galaxy.dat. Supplied by Wayne Hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).  iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of GIFs from Voyager, Hubble, and other sources available by anonymous FTP in pub/gif (most of this data is also in SPACE/GIF on the Ames server).

LANDSAT AND NASA PHOTOS  You can get black-and-white 1:1M prints, negatives, or positives for $10, $18, $12 respectively for any Landsat data more than 2 years old from EDC, (Eros (Earth Resources Orbiting Satellite) Data Center). Call them at (605)-594-6511. You get 80 meter resolution from the MSS scanner, 135x180 kilometers on a picture 135x180 mm in size. I think you have to select one band from (green, red, near IR, second near IR), but I'm not sure. Digitial data is also available at higher prices.  Transparencies of all NASA photos available to the public can be borrowed from the NASA photo archive; you can have copies or prints made.  NASA Audio-Visual Facility 918 North Rengstorff Ave Mountain View, CA  94043 (415)-604-6270   PLANETARY MAPS  The USGS address for maps of the planets is:  U.S. Geological Survey, Distribution Branch, Box 25286, Federal Center, Bldg. 41 Denver, CO 80225  Maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).  The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 1:15,000,000 scale in 3 sheets.

Bussard, Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust"" interplanetary flight is not possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a 53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in Earth/moon space.

[This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in 1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim Bowery]  ""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]  ION DRIVES:  Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in the 1960s and 70s.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.  Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news frequently.   WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?  The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).  The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102, says:  ""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target in second stage.""  This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try to interpret.  1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.  2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the ""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of ""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.  3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").  4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver complexity"").  5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").  6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.  7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.  This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top"" [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle guy.)  I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array.   HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT  NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72 degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g. shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite for these viewers.  If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT. It's worth asking if yours doesn't.  The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions are not being covered.   AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS  The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:  W6FXN  - Los Angeles K6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.

59905.eml,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS  This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS   MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)  MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.  MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).  MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.  MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the geological and biological sense.  MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface of an ocean.  MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic measurements of MARINER 4.  MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed.  MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.  MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover, plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.   PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)  PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.  PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to 36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7, and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.  PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER 11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever to do so.  PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER 12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus 2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed.   RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)  RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.  RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit. RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.  RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside, the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.  RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon and drifted off into solar orbit.  RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.   LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)  LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside. All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S. probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.   SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)  The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.  Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7, the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored the Tycho crater region in 1968.   VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)  VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.  The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the engineers' efforts through May of 1983.  An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.  VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in 1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut down on April 12, 1980.  The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.   VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)  VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March 5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7, 1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto, but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.  Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.  When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance. The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids, kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.  VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts, continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered.  In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather, including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)  The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS  Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:   SOVIET LUNAR PROBES  LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first craft in solar orbit. LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959. LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959. ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was also a test for future Mars missions. LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images from surface. LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966. LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966. ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle. LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 1972. LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973. LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in 1976.   SOVIET VENUS PROBES  VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions lost enroute in 1961. VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in February of 1966. No images were returned. VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966. VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles similar in 1969. VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 1972. VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO. VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in March of 1986.   SOVIET MARS PROBES  MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased enroute the following year. ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965. MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red Planet in 1971. MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971. MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to fire, probe went on into solar orbit. MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. probe MARINER 9. MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface. MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit with its flyby bus. PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human/computer error. PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week before scheduled Phobos landing.  While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon, Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS  SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for a Japanese spacecraft.  During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).   HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24, 1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.  The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March 19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.  Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15, 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the approach:  Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) Period		: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES  I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.  Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library. Some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market bookstore.  General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):  J.

Other works and periodicals:  NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study some of the books listed above.  Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER, SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions, but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you probably know.  Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue, Pasadena, California 91106 USA.  Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

If you have basic information requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1), etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.  EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one of the below, this is their job:  NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government. It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees are civil servants and hence US citizens.

59909.eml,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES  Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.   ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters.   CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.  One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.  The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn's rings.

Has returned the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite, into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon.   MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity map.   MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera. Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year (687 days).   TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched 8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.   ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.  Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!  While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

It will scan the entire sky every six months to search for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.  o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket] Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.  o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01] Gather radar images of Earth's surface.  o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket] Study of Stratospheric ozone.  o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS] Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be recovered after it conducts the various scientific and engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.  1994 o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket] June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the Earth.  o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02] International Microgravity Laboratory.  o ADEOS [NASDA] Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.  o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS] Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.  1995 LUNAR-A [ISAS] Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the moon's interior.   Proposed Missions: o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF) Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for 15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.  o Earth Observing System (EOS) Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science including planetary evolution.  o Mercury Observer Possible 1997 launch.  o Lunar Observer Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would survey characteristics to provide a global context for the results from the Apollo program.  o Space Infrared Telescope Facility Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant infrared-emitting galaxies  o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.  o Fire and Ice Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in 2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.   NEXT: FAQ #12/15 - Controversial questions"

Minovitch, _Utilizing Large Planetary Perubations for the Design of Deep-Space Solar-Probe and Out of Ecliptic Trajectories_, Technical Report 32-849, JPL, Pasadena, Calif., 1965.

Box 605 Amherst, NY 14226-0605   COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS  Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.  (1/3.4) D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km g  p  f  n  (1/6) S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface e		      t gravity of the target body. This scaling is cited for lunar craters and may hold true for other bodies.  (1/3.4) S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  , p	  a   t							    t p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U a crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average rock on the continental shields.  C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).  (1/3.4) K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent) n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U nuclear test crater.  3		   2		       19 W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  ) : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3 g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.  An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing asteroids.  Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in diameter.  More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):  Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)  10			    10		     10^-8		10^9 1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6 0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3  assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.  References:  Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41. [an excellent general overview of the subject for the layman]  Shoemaker, E.M. 1983 Asteroid and comet bombardment of the earth. _Ann. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci._ 11, 461-494.

Cunningham, C.J. 1988 _Introduction to Asteroids: The Next Frontier_ (Richmond: Willman-Bell, Inc.) [covers all aspects of asteroid studies and is an excellent introduction to the subject for people of all experience levels. It also has a very extensive reference list covering essentially all of the reference material in the field.]   MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY  Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the ""Encyclopaedia Brittanica"", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).  More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32 projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.  You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland, ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.  You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS: Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.  A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos, (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.  A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:  R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"", Byte V12 #14, December 1987  Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.  Some references for spherical trignometry are:  _Spherical Astronomy_, W.M. Smart, Cambridge U. Press, 1931.  _A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy_, S. Newcomb, Dover, 1960.  _Spherical Astronomy_, R.M. Green, Cambridge U. Press., 1985 (update of Smart).  _Spherical Astronomy_, E Woolard and G.Clemence, Academic Press, 1966.   PERFORMING N-BODY SIMULATIONS EFFICIENTLY  ""Computer Simulation Using Particles"" R. W. Hockney and J. W. Eastwood (Adam Hilger; Bristol and Philadelphia; 1988)  ""The rapid evaluation of potential fields in particle systems"", L. Greengard MIT Press, 1988.  A breakthrough O(N) simulation method. Has been parallelized.  L. Greengard and V. Rokhlin, ""A fast algorithm for particle simulations,"" Journal of Computational Physics, 73:325-348, 1987.  ""An O(N) Algorithm for Three-dimensional N-body Simulations"", MSEE thesis, Feng Zhao, MIT AILab Technical Report 995, 1987  ""Galactic Dynamics"" J. Binney & S. Tremaine (Princeton U. Press; Princeton; 1987)  Includes an O(N^2) FORTRAN code written by Aarseth, a pioneer in the field.  Hierarchical (N log N) tree methods are described in these papers:  A. W. Appel, ""An Efficient Program for Many-body Simulation"", SIAM Journal of Scientific and Statistical Computing, Vol. 6, p. 85, 1985.  Barnes & Hut, ""A Hierarchical O(N log N) Force-Calculation Algorithm"", Nature, V324 # 6096, 4-10 Dec 1986.  L. Hernquist, ""Hierarchical N-body Methods"", Computer Physics Communications, Vol. 48, p. 107, 1988.   INTERPRETING THE FITS IMAGE FORMAT  If you just need to examine FITS images, use the ppm package (see the comp.graphics FAQ) to convert them to your preferred format. For more information on the format and other software to read and write it, see the sci.astro.fits FAQ.   SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)  The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations. Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license to  E. Miya MS 258-5 NASA Ames Research Center Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 eugene@orville.nas.nasa.gov   THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES  To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and scale this by the distance.  Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25 parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on ames.arc.nasa.gov).

60103.eml,sci.space,"Archive-name: space/acronyms Edition: 8  Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle: Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7 Last posted: 1992 Aug 27  This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  Thanks, Larry!

Is there a single Titan III on order?  The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt to market it.  They're basically happy with their government business and don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.  A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly.  They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so.  There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached orbit properly. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry"

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  ""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.  Paul F. Dietz dietz@cs.rochester.edu"

Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.  Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.

It ran a little fast (I think) for simple Newtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.

60187.eml,sci.space,"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence  The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality. Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.   -- Nick Szabo					 szabo@techboook.com"

60199.eml,sci.space,"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten' op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

Anyone out there know?  Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.  Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...)  Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.  And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers that show %20 ROI, fund me...)   Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

60215.eml,sci.space,"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific. Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.  John."

Beyond that, I have no other info.  The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne  ""Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe.""                       - G.

It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.

60229.eml,sci.space,"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev."

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""  His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular, however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.   -- Covert C Beach dragon@access.digex.com"

The article starts with ""A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research ""is a real question for me."" O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including ""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.""  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate"" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""  The last sentence in the article contradicts the title & the first paragraph. The sentence reads ""He [O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned space station Freedom is still possible within the administration's budget guidelines."""

20362.eml,soc.religion.christian,"Hi...  I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): ""We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.""

20488.eml,soc.religion.christian,"I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.  =======================================================================  D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?   Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs, tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, ""God Loves You.""  Isn't that true?  A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:  For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but have everlasting life.                               John 3:16  However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:  The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9  For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6   Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How can these verses apply to me?  A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven. On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before God.  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.                                            Romans 3:10-11  The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9   Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?  A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.  For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. Deuteronomy 32:22-24   Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not that bad.  A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ- ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering.  And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15  So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50  ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9   Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?  A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands payment for sin.  For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23  For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5:10  But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matthew 12:36   Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?  A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.  All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6  But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him; and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5  For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4  For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 2 Corinthians 5:21   Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about Hell anymore?  A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God. Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.  He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36   Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to Hell?  A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins and serve Christ as our Lord.  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Matthew 6:24  Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19   Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their followers also go to Hell?  A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account- able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us.  Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be saved.                                               Acts 4:12  Jesus said:  I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6  If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9   Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?  A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13  ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ... Acts 16:30-31   Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?  A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.  For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8  God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So, if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is the only Word of God. In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.  So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.                                              Romans 10:17   Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?  A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.  The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17  Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to Hell.  Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26   Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be baptized?  Will these save me?  A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us. No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas- ure.  Salvation is  Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9   Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?  A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever- more.  For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God: and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17   Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?  A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever- more.  But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ... Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Peter 3:10,13   Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come?  A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to save.  And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end come.                                            Matthew 24:14   Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?  A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.  For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3  Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7   Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.  A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4   Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?  A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.  But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9   Q. Did God hear their prayers?  A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.   Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg- ment?  A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short.  How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3  In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?    A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.   I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

20490.eml,soc.religion.christian,"I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say ""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay ""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord's presence.  So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.

He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.  The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).

There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  ""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with >knowledge?  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another take"" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap. Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.  Link Hudson."

Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle? > >In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. >There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ? >I don't know.  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.

It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.  What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.  Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we ""graded"" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account? I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.  -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like ""even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.""  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and ""Holy Tradition"" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.  --clh]"

20508.eml,soc.religion.christian,"{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, ""Hermeneutrik und Kritik,"" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of ""rules for forgers.""  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works. Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book? If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to ask are, ""Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?""  If there are things which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.  The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain (particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies). However often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer."

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head their own ""churches"").

Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

You wrote that ""I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ"".  Well, Christ referred to God as ""My Father"", not ""My Mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.

The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live in fear of what will happen when I  die.  I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.  I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.  <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  ""Oh wow..all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.  Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.  It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a ""non-believer"", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.

Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes. I don't see how that necessarily follows.  Are all truths also absolutes? Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?  If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, and which truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding Biblical interpretation.

While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement. I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.  Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org"

I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with Christianity and reject what isn't.  We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important. Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and service.

20520.eml,soc.religion.christian,"I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings. now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine ""Fall of the Church"" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church. It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their ""soul alone with Jesus"" approach, but for we who see the ""ecclesia"" as a ""koinoia"" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  ""The soul alone with God"" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was ""wierd"".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of ""revisionism"" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION  1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His body because that would have perpetrated the resurrection--the very opposite of what they desired.  2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His body because Pontius Pilate established guards to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be stolen.  3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus had risen from the dead.  4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He *would indeed* rise from the dead.  5.  The probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"

[ . . . ]  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to ""get 'em in and get 'em out"".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.} -- --- Tim Rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu"

Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that AIDS is ""deserved"" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge ""others"" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.  >I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people didn't get >involved in deviant sexual behaviour. Certainly, people who >received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes >to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.  So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in ""deviant"" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.  >In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. >There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ? >I don't know.  The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

[text deleted] >Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* >careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for >sin.  I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions. I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago): >Last week I was guilty of anger, jealousy, and whole mess of >other stuff, yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with >AIDs.  To even suggest that AIDS is ""deserved"" is ludicrous.  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings: >In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when >I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and >phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other >socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through >their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus...  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is ""obvious""ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgive them Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  ""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.""  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,  Aaron Cardenas"

In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal. He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or nothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law? Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you believe that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.  BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only required to observe the basis commandmants.

First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16. The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but ""(at best) second-hand"".  ""And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?""

I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)  >     Additionally, what he has written is >     again second-hand info if it were given by the Spirit, >     and still carries the chance it is not true.  The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as ""inspired by God"", literally means ""God-breathed"".  In other words, God spoke the actual words into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of ""inspired by God"".  >The only way you would be able to escape this notion of >     ""second-hand"" info is to have had the entire Bible >     written by God himself.

If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus? In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims. The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out. About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the least without the Spirit's guidance:  ""For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.""

This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the ""super-apostles"" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.""  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the ""praying of Jesus into your life for salvation"".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted.

Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.

Let us say a little The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from ""Christians"".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some ""Christian"" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  >The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches >(denominations) with the same characteristics.

As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states: In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities: devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for God all having everything in common. glad and sincere hearts praising God enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, ""a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).  >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the >  true church of Jesus Christ?  One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  > >A problem closely related to these question is: >- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - >  before there is a unity?

As for those who think about only one church being the ""true one"", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  >Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you. >For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which >are founded by people of one specific church and whose members >are all members of that church.

A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something ""correct"" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without.  >Thanks for your opinions in advance! > >Maarten  Joe Fisher"

To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was ""the free rein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""the dialectical forces of history"". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  ""I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."" (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that ""there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, ""there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."" (Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man.  Joe Fisher  [""The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right"" may not be as obvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didn't have? Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by our chronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did ""have Jesus"". Even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicit knowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar. --clh]"
20548.eml,soc.religion.christian,"THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?  by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D. (1894-1977)  When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third day He shall rise again"" (Matthew 20:18-19).  Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus, who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly how He would die--*by crucifixion.*  All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.  But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec- tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris- tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.  The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment, they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).  How did this tomb become empty?  One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America-- professor of New Testament literature in a large theological seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how* the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the chimney at Christmas time.  But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.  Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi- bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.  Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University, tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt) that the women went to the wrong tomb.  The facts are these:  First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone.  Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to the wrong tomb?  Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?  There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.  Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  And when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept.  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.  So they took the money, and did as they were taught:  and this saying is com- monly reported among the Jews until this day (Matthew 28:11-15).  This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty.  You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.  Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*  How could they know what was going on while they were asleep? Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.  Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation, the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of Jesus.  First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected, then proved.  Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent. It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most of these men did.  The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.  But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to Him.  Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.  He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11- 18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).  A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3- 8).  As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor- ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances.  Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle. Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale; Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.  But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this: it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.  Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He claimed to have come down *from* God.  He said He was the way *to* God.  He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.  He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one else had it.  He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to us.  Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*  Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe that His words are all true?  The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?  And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.  In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan- ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.  Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know."

Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.

I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't. I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement. First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches. Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option. Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option. I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never see God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell. Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal, and it's a lot worse than Heaven.  That's the only comparison that matters.

20554.eml,soc.religion.christian,"I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of ""arrogance of Christians"" and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  I'd ask, ""How do you know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you know you're daddy is right?""  ""He says he's always right!""  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?

I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.  --clh]"

The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.  I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.  Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world?  I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.  As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.  May the Lord bring peace to you,  Malcusco"

Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.

I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not constitute what the Apostle Paul called ""becoming all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.""  Don't say ""Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time on."" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not creator.

Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.  When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.

The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of ""pagan goddess"" by celebrating Easter.  It is nonsense to say ""this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it.""  Words and practices don't mean things, people do.

20565.eml,soc.religion.christian,"The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend: Corpus Christi - W 12st St. Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, ""clean"", largely gay Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God.   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.   >Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never >see God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell.  I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))  I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...   >  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal,  Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died: ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now."" ?  Consider the following statement: ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.""  The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).  You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.  Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (""Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?"" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.   >and it's a lot worse than Heaven.  That's the only comparison that matters.  That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. ""Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?"" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, ""Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.""

The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a contradiction in terms.  Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, ""There are no absolutes"" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.  >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding >Biblical interpretation.  So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.

You might start with Mack's book on Q and then examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your ""evidence"" is not as sturdy as you'd like.

No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you. The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy  [I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically because they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other than a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event -- in effect, a delusion.  --clh]"

I Peter 3:7  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her. He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family. One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.   Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org"

The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.  The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.  The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.  Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.  The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.

Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.  You have to be very careful about what you mean by ""question authority"". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say ""I question to word of this authority"" is ridiculous. If it is open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be ""authenticate authority."" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.  The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.  In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.  To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.    -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He is opposed to evil.  I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting Christ.  I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with putting into words and explaining that love.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.  What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.  On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.  In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.  In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.  Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.  Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.  Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.  When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver.  The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable"" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings.  -------  This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.  Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.  As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

53296.eml,talk.politics.guns,"---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.  1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that contention.  2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories, demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back- grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.  3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law, compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975- 1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?  4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""? Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite ""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado Springs. (Ref. 3)  5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection, registration figures are meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two, that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.  The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail- ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and Vancouver.  6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually the case.  7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns, or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences, the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention most factors related to crime control.  8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost 650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms.  9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,"" editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25 and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs, administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough. It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.  Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.  REFERENCES  1.

Wright (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)  Someone once wrote: ""Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a community."" The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period 1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver. Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes, Why? The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning, that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established. Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed- weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything. Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what. The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words, that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa. In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause. Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all else is equal"" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city. Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability"" (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally, do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.) Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian percentage? The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver."" The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime. Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables, and their results are impossible to interpret. In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals-- is cause for further concern.  [James D.

53297.eml,talk.politics.guns,"The ATF agent interviewed on ""Street Stories"" reported that the raid was ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was coming. WHY?  I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.  Important dates: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.  On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent on ""Street Stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". I believe this attack continued, even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.  ...rich"

That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)  So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.  Frank Crary CU Boulder"

No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns.

Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.  >As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife >than a gun, thanks.  ""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.  >...Fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't >another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have >much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife >assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).  Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat"" nearly as often as they do guns.  Frank Crary CU Boulder"

I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000 (National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.  >...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun >homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.  Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not supporting ""reasonable"" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you are supporting.

53337.eml,talk.politics.guns,I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the Gun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did to get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the White House Lawn. And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the BD's are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue.  They are heroes in the fight against oppressive government;  it could just as well have been you. -watkins@earth.eecs.uic.edu  (Brian E Watkins)

What do you think 75% of you is?  But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.  >>  Plus these things have no self- >>defense purposes.

I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern, found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.  Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.  Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas.  Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. They remember being ""relocated"" by the US Army, and don't intend to do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers.  -- Kirk Hays - NRA Life, seventh generation.

53366.eml,talk.politics.guns,"Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what it said about self-defense with a firearm.  I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon."" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.  Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference?

54117.eml,talk.politics.guns,"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith  LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:  I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note.  First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime. More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary.  Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense.  Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"". Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are.  Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  So what's the point?  L.

The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.  In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into this country has greatly decreased. This is because its value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical. Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way. You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a good dollar/pound deal.  Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area. It would not be economic to smuggle them in. All production would have to be local. There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it."

The discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is ludicrous.  Awesley replied: I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it, supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.  The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.

""When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment.""  Well, it's not the main gun.  ""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?  I wrote: will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American cities in the Sixties.  Awesley replied: Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main guns.  I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  Awesley goes on: You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  And on: I don't expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know what you find.  I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.

The University cops here (who are >are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most >state cops are.  Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first, but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk"" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.  -- ""If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect."" -BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX."

Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what do you base this?

Wow, you gotta love the speculation.  As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through.  It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically (not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and subsequent development and urbanization of these former private hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.  >So, now why should we allow hunting ... to prevent over-population of >the deer/bear/<whatever> ?

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.

Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke ""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was one common dialect.

I never said that these alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware. Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the good neighbors step up and say ""THAT'S the one officer ! He was robbing Mr. Jones' house"".  In short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.

Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland]. Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to be a proper reaction [and so does the law]. Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be more deadly.  -- Michael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain rights.

This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore"" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.  On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.  Rawlinson wired to his superiors,  ""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed.""  >Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:  Come again?  : ""These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to... >(34 lines deleted)  Why?  : No wonder you are in such a mess.

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** > 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of > the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel? First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town on a rail.   chag sameach! jeff"

Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) said it best when writing in his diary in 1940: ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal ^^^                  ^^^ of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country. The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out."" DAVAR, 29 September, 1967 (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)  Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get something back.   ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which).  Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !  I think that is fair enough .  No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction. Guess where that takes your logic?

I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However, i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it.  As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs.

My 'k' key works overtime as it is just to  Then what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?   ""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.""  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.""  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.""  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.""  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We have never got any of the bodies back.""  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.""  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today.   Source: Stanford J.

According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.

That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.  I like California oranges. And the feelings may get sharper at the table.    Regards,  Dorin"

Done. But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""  Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.  ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian! I don't need your bias.""  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.  [1] James G.

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?  An Appeal to Mankind  During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.  The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace.  The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.  Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.  One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States.  One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan.  It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR.  We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.  But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands.  The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.  But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes?  All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

When did the press report >   it to the world?  But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.  Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far.  >   Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front >   page?

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.  Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992  MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED  Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan. The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes. But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.  Scalping Reported Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies. ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us."" The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""  Truckloads of Bodies Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer, Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies. ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

75407.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17 To the children of genocide: ""Send them away into the Desert""  This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:  ""To the Government of Aleppo.  November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people.  Minister of the Interior,  Talaat"" [1]  ""To the Government of Aleppo.  September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.  Minister of the Interior, Talaat"" [2]  ""To the General Committee for settling and deportees.  November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile.  Abdullahad Nuri. [3]   ""To the Government of Aleppo.  January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them.  Minister of the Interior,  Talaat."" [4]  ""To the Government of Aleppo.   Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with the caravans.  Minister of the Interior,  Talaat"" [5]  ""From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.  At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.  Minister of the Interior,  Talaat"" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and ""rationalizing"" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:  ""I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I shall die for it."" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these ""death march orders"" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample ""authentic text"" provided in the Turkish Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.  Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.  - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and London), 1926, page 387   -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | ""How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

75408.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]   Born 1972 Attended 9th Grade Middle School No. 17  Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.  When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians.  We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death to the Armenians"" was written on the cars.  When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too.  When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left.  We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . .  They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They had knives and steel truncheons.  I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.  We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.  We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK.  But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.  In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th.  Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.  My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.  They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely.  At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.  My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.   My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.  Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.  While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped  . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .  Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia.  After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that.  I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.  You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer. I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do. With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis.  |> 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of |> the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel?  Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel, as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves.   -- Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers, OS Software Engineer    | Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

Depew has shown himself to be unrepentant (though embarrassed) and >still possessed of the same fucked-up hubris-laden self-righteousness that  The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi Armenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.  What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset, the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore, when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area. Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]  For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:  ""They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.""  As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:  ""Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area.""[2]  Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war. What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]  At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars, Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities, but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]  [1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), ""Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,"" (Istanbul, 1918).

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation, is attention-getting.  This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.  In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event, today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides. What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway? Do you think it was your right to be there? I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?""  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.  I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, ""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't know what to do with the rest.""  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, ""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.  When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my dead body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"" Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy.""  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, ""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She says, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?"" And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

75884.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"[It looks like Yigal has been busy...]  RTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION  By Adrian Croft SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, Reuter - Nineteen people, including the son of former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them. Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court. The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies. The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ""a massive spying operation."" The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information. Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring. The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages. Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her. One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister. Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories. According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists. In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities. No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing. REUTER AC KG CM    APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit  Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.  By CATALINA ORTIZ Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network. The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court. ""None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None of us is violent or criminal in any way,"" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture. The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians. ""The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,"" Arens said. The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York headquarters. The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED. Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation. The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information ""not otherwise public"" from state or federal records. The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to ""persons and entities"" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate. Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard. Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock. Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines. Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it.      UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents  SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments. The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADL and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and South Africa's apartheid policy. The ADL refused to comment on the suit. The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San Francicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws. According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these files were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges. ""The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant,"" said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing the plaintiffs. The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years. ""My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate,"" said Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California. ""The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite."" The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the operation for four months. The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens.

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel revise this preliminary draft as necessary:  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further provocation is required.  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans without positive identification as military personnel, clear indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.  a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades, AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive military identification and require closer inspection such as document checks.  b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent, which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round, as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source. As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify armed response.  c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive military identification of all personnel in the target area of the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire. For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated if necessary.  --- D. C.

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them? January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold 1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem, after cutting off the supply lines to it. Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from land links with the rest of the Jewish population. The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off, while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were slaughtered, cutting off the villiage. Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews had been killed.  Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking. Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin? Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?   >-- >Joseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades, >jaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief. >Disclaimer?

Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah, those wonderful ""mainstream moderates"" with whom Israel is attempting to negotiate.  Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads. I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary _Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death- squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back the execution of a ""collaborator?""  3 photos: 1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint. 2) The ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple. 3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the ""collaborator shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.  Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights. Remember Black September? Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.  I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?

The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable.

You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.  As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ?

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.   Dorin"

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.

75909.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program about Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian military coup against the democratically elected Algerian Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth. A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .  --jamshid"

As per request of Hasan:  From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:  [pp. 225-227]  ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties.  ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].  ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'  ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa.""   [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin?  As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic.  And we still demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.  Now what would you do?  Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)  ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.  The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh. Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and feared dead. The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives."" "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing. One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.  The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range. Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and killing one person.

Polymenakos) writes:  > Maybe with the availability of anon servers some people are beginning to >speak out?  I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.  And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in April 21, 1915, ""thanking it for its services to Russia.""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages.

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:  ""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights; loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.""  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  ""Major Principles of the Constitution""  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice, human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions. Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color, sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  ""Structure of the State""  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and ""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).  A. Legislative Power:  The ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" is a parliament with one House, elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:  - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws; - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers; - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers; - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets; - to ratify international agreements; - to grant amnesty or pardons.  Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age of twenty-one can vote.  Elections are supervised by the ""Supreme Council of Elections,"" which solves all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local ""Board of Election"" runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among independent judges.  B. Executive Power:  The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:  - to represent the State and the Country; - to insure the implementation of the Constitution; - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions; - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; - to ratify laws and government decrees.  The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may call for a referendum.  Executive power is exercised by the ""Council of Ministers,"" headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?) Ministers in the Council.  Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent ""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or functions against any law.  C. Judicial Power:  Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:  - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice upon the appeal of the parties involved. - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law. The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the high administrative court.  The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the ""Constitutional Court"" if they contradict the Constitution. If found contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

75938.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives. The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the Holocaust is a myth, archivists say. ""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules."" The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria. Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje] The German word Himmler uses that is translated as ""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*. Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation"" or ""tearing up by the roots."" In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, ""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives. Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945. The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum here on April 26. The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.  ---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914.   'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?' (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), ""The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi"", p. 213.)   I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians. With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it. By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""  Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.  ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian! I don't need your bias.""  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.  [1] James G.

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, ""Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,"" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.  SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau."" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published.. And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given by Serdar Argic exist!!

Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.  Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank, Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of 3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from occupying the city.  The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours' distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.  At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar, Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.  Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori, they continued to spread death and destruction among the Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down their arms.

Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose.  Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return.  Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.  Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code.  --Tim Smith"

What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.  As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....  During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an ""economist"" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly ""supply side"" policy, since taxes do not ""cause"" economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he is.  Paul Collacchi"

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.  >Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price >machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.  Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred.  > >> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but >> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) > >Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an >array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores >embedded in a relatively free market?  Can you spell ""loss leader?""  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.  There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur. (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that ""government bureaucracy"" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account.  jsh  > >=Mark -- Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM ""One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t."" - R.

176866.eml,talk.politics.misc,"Replying to A.J. Teel:  Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a while now.  Humbug.  Those letters don't provide ""concrete proof"" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.  Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).  Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material ""concrete proof"".  There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their reasons for disbelief at this point.  Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court.  Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you?  Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the opposition has forfeited the field?  With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.  For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 ""admiralty jurisdiction"" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?  Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a ""14th Amendment federal citizen""?  When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong?  Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).  Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.  Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a ""14th Amend- ment federal citizen"", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign tax credit).  -- Rich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

It makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around.  It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition.

This changes the whole argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.

He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.  >John Eaton >!hp-vcd!johne"

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.  The number of people who participate in ""victimless"" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    ""Any town having more churches than bars has a serious social problem."" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's) --------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.  If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together ""with good will on both sides"", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.  Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Rick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED Disclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_ #  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.  This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  # 	Craig A.

Double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge. However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating Mr. King's civil rights.  AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states, it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence.

In practice, communism has ""solved"" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of ""kulaks"" in the USSR is a good instance of this. A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed him off, or been killed? Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to socialists in Chile.

The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the ""B"" word, or the ""H"" word, or even the ""N"" or ""W"" words. It is the ""L"" word - LOSER !!  That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.  Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are ""too young"" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about ""How America Learned to Win Once Again"". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few ""little"" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good.  In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a ""kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who ""don't get it"". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no suggestion of losing.  But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our ""white male"" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a ""Hail Mary"" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days.  Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?  What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, ""Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser."" And so on.  The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some ""equitable"" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority.  Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a ""neoconservative"" or a ""neoliberal"" depending on how much you want to limit the pot.  Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl someday)    Bill R.  --  ""The only proposals in the Senate that I         ""My opinions do not represent have seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer or praiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency.""

Reese, 179 Misc. 665, 40 N.Y.S.2d 468, 472; Zimmerman, 175 Or. 585, 155 P.2d 293, 295.  It requires only bodily presence as an inhabitant of a place.  In re Campbell's Guardianship, 216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.  As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place, they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S. 209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite period if intent to return remains.  Immigration Act 1917, sec. 3, 8 U.S.C.A. sec. 136 (e, p).  Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting, C.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d 732, 733.  But see, Ward v.

Craig, 182 Okl. 610, 80 P 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are synonymous terms.  ``Residence'' has a meaning dependent on context and purpose of statute.  In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282. Words ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable meaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  Kemp v. Kemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172 Misc. 738.  Legal residence.  See Legal.  RESIDENT.  One who has his residence in a place.  See Residence.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.  Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!    -- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

176935.eml,talk.politics.misc,"Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato Institute points out.  According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies, we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of 1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically.  When standards of living, population densities, and industrial structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group of Seven nations.  Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product, even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall U.S. economy.  Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.  Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not reduce demand.  Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance, gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state at the expense of the individual.  ""Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion"" is no. 189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from: Cato Institute 224 Second Street SE Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     The Cato Institute  Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the traditional American principles of limited government, individual liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in questions of policy and the proper role of government. The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation of the American Revolution. Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for civil liberties. To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal. In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations, corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from the sale of publications.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC  20006.  Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far more than that.  The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.  Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.  To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be.  There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.  The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an ""armada"" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.  The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire.  Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.  The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy.  My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:  Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.  Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them.  The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.  The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.  Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the major media is ""oil.""  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island.  South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.  In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain.  But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all?  My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly.  The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them.  The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.  What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world.  The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.  Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.  When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war.  In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places.  The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war.  He accomplished this as so-called ""Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense"" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources.  Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36.  Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers.  The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth.  In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.  The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.  The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.  At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war.  In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.  The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific.  In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.  Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction.  The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea.  Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island!  The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques.  The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear powered--nuclear ""subs""; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way!  The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference.  Last month I revealed that the so-called ""Stealth Program"" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity.  A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field.  After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war.  These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the ""Falklands crisis.""  Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described ""PROJECT Z"", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE.  An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia.  Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.  Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is fast running out.  The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways.  In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called ""Falkland crisis"" now dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.  The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.  The exact details of the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month.  It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.  It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable.  Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.  But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.  As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do.  As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.  On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship ""Endurance"" put 22 Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag.  The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.  During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  ""Nothing new"", thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.  Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas.  The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, ""Me, too"" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.  Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide.  On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations.  That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on ""Red Alert.""  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing ""sea trials"", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.  On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials.  He got them!  For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The official stories about ""slow movement"" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.  It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan.  Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced.  Then a Russian ""sub"" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is known, there were no survivors.  This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important:  First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.  The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand!  The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, ""Time is running out."" And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.  The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was still out of range.  The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them.  Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed.  Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines.  The ""subs"" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world.  The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.  Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.  At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.  Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called ""nuclear freeze movement.""  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war.  We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it.  What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war.  The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers.  The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.  The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power.  These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working name, though this may be changed, is the ""World Nonproliferation Council.""  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.  LAST MINUTE SUMMARY  Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand.  My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture tells us, our Lord ""...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.""  We must learn to wage peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.""  Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you, and may God bless each and every one of you."

Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death....

176941.eml,talk.politics.misc,"THE WHITE HOUSE  Office of the Press Secretary (Vancouver, British Columbia) _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                               April 4, 1993   PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT WITH RUSSIAN PRESS  Canada Place Vancouver, British Columbia    2:46 P.M. PDT   Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)  THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)  Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What are the priorities, because there are several association of Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment?  This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not very enthusiastic?  Thank you.  Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.  THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have some influence over the distribution of.  With regard to your second question, let me say that I would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole history of America, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular.  What I have tried to tell the American people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the Russian side.  So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the United States.  This is very much in the interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country.  Russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful investment.  Like all investments, there is some risk.  But there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the Cold War.  Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough.  I have two questions.  One, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions inherited from the Cold War?  PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that.  I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join the NPT regime is critical.  What was the second question?  THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the Congress.  With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be much less.  With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future.  Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the last part of your speech?  THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as I could about your history.  And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a personal feeling about Russia.  I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it occurred.  These are things that have always had a big impact on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)  THE PRESS:  Thank you.  END3:06 P.M. PDT"

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02. First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.  >	The political implications are simple.

On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did. The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago. My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.  >	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be >popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still >be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I >would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it >is the only way to go.  That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).  If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.  >Bill R.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ""At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

EDT  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out the first pitch.  Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not Amtrack.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.  Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with  ??? Senate?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be passed.  Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President believes his jobs program should go forward.  Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today.  Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's see what happens.  Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days.  Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package through?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.  Q	     prepared to compromise --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole.  Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.  Q	  How?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall.  Q	  He can't beat this, can he?  Q	  The fact is they can do that?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop action.  There's no question about that.  Q	  What are you going to do about it?  Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that when they say yes they mean no?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process. I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.  Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.  Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not positive.  Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --  Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, ""when the Japanese say yes they mean no.""  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.  Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual observation.  Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how many.  Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is on.  Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that.  Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.  Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, Saddam can't stay in office?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it.  Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism.  Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you base that?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections. He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments.  Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power.  Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - -  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.  Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that. You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.  Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer?  Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives?  Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes? Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes?  When you have to go through --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he can.  Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.  Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --  Q	     any ideas.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.  Q	     to present them.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean they get the votes --  Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.  Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?  Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about anything recently.  Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation, including the situation in Los Angeles.  I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to watch it.  Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management.  Does the President have a position on that?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty. He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game.  Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.  Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it.  Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the President?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore.  Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, yes.  Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward. The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.  Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action.  But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all.  Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.  Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your question.  Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what does the U.S. do next?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement.  Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When does no mean no and you have to do something different?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.  Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something that is under consideration.  Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition, how he's doing?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.  Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit.  Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.  Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks. I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks.  Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the magnitude.  Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where do you stand on that --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a hard look at it.  Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll be able to get our own researchers working as well.  Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under discussion.  Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens.  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll continue to review other matters.  Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule this week?  Any travel?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right now.  Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks. We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions.  Thanks.   ###"

EDT  Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's protest today?  THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest. I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado. And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good.  Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.  Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture?  THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it.  And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.  THE PRESS:  Thank you.  END11:50 A.M. EDT"

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it. -- Clayton E.

After all, the bomb was a single act.  First, I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead of New York is going after the bombers. This means no capital punishment.  Secondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after you for first one murder, then the next, etc. A ""sovereign"" has essentially one chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing). That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the deaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once.

82777.eml,talk.religion.misc,"ZOROASTRIANISM SAN JOSE, CA, USA Monday April 5, 1993 San Jose Mercury News, Page 1 [Reproduced without permission]  _3,700-year tradition still glows - 'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_  By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer  HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States - dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.  With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.  ""There is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. ""We have one generation to do it or to die.""  Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.  Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.  Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.  Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.  Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.  ""It's important to have an identity,"" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  ""It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.""  For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.  Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_  Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.  But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.  Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""  So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.  About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.  Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""good deeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.  The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.  Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.  The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.  Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just a symbol of God.  ""It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,"" Bhujwala said.  The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.  ""The good things in life are not forbidden,"" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.  Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.  Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""People eat the fruit,"" Tarapore said.  ""It's a way to participate in the ceremony.""  _Santa Claus, sort of_  The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.  He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.  The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  ""This is all new for us, too,"" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.  A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.  But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.

The reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one too many Christians tell me ""the Bible contains no contradictions whatsoever.""  They believe that it's true, and that it describes reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.  Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people, I've got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with this list.  Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat denials.

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z""l).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave ""gifts"" (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.

You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of interference in your life. (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.

If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.

We can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice, tolerance, etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just because someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.

Hopefully the LDS netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say ""no good"" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 1993 edition):  ""I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon-- or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good American might be ""one who doesn't draw exclusive circles"" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to draw a circle around ""Mormon"" or ""Christian,"" to decide who is ""orthodox"" and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider that the central pillar of Christ's ""orthodoxy"" is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.  ""I recently spent some time in a ""Christian"" bookstore in California. The service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons. But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to ""Cults and the Occult,"" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).  ""It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (""Perfect love casteth out fear,"" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive action---as the ""religious right wing"" has launched this year against the political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like. It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would, if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of others they believe to be evil.""   The above ""sermon"" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.  Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled ""Christian"", if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of *fabrication*.  About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called ""Son o' God"" comics. It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said the magic word, he turned into ""Son o' God."" He went from a myopic, curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile features.  Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.  This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the NatLamp Jesus was.   ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu"

No matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.

82801.eml,talk.religion.misc,"The primary problem in human nature is a ""fragmentation of being."" Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called ""theosis,"" or ""deification.""  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.  Mark"

""Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.""  MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...  _____________________________________________________________________  HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN"" =============================================================  This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.  _____________________________________________________________________  Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...  _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]... > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. > Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks > on this way down, tearing his body open.

But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.  Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.  DB... ""At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:  > (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas' >     death.

Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""  MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.  To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is ""begging the question"", if I may quote you.  [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]  DB... ""This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.""  MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.  DB...

""In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Greek word ""apagchw""(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.""  MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.  The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.  In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.  Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means ""hang oneself"".  DB... ""But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.""  MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] ""Reputable""?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^  As I said in an earlier post...  _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.  MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.  First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________  I also wrote...  _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...  Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:  MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said, ""What is that to us? You see to it!""  MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.  MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""  MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.  MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.  Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself."" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.  ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'  Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.  .......  MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________  I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^  DB... ""By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  ""The Biblical Knowledge Commentary"" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""  MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...  _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________  DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).""  MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.  DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""  MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!  ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'  Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry? ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give something to the poor.  So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave?  DB...

I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""Greek Lexicon"" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed ""chorion.""  Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:  ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"" ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm ""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale ""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:  A space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,"" land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).  By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of ""agros,"" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word ""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).  So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the ""Potter's Field.""

It is, > however, highly probable.                   ^^^^^^  and  > Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply > means ""hang oneself"".  Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:  ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"" ""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm ""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale ""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is ""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).  The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill."" In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is denoted as the result).  By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":  > In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), > it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice > was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, > to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and > died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.""   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > ^^^^ > Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept., > APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the > result. > In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.  Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing ""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.  Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.  By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:  > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.  Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).  Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:  > As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather > than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically > mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions > what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning > Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").

Rather, it states > that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"". > But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and > obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry? >          ^^^^^^  True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal ""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took the money box, but rather said:  ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and it was night.""  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.  Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).  Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:  > Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss > this with you.  I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues.  Later,  Dave Butler  A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence. David Hume, Philosopher An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding  PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant. Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely ""possible"" reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the best you can do is say that the Bible is ""possibly"" inerrant, not that it *is* inerrant."

This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, ""My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung."" And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of. It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.

As it is now, we don't see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only ""responsibility"" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us ""feel responsible"" without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to ""feel"" like good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say ""I'm good"", and the rest of the world can burn. Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.

At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too ""christian"".  At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.

Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times ""Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period""; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that ""the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia"" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, ""provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade""; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by ""following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth"" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a ""small fishing village"" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had ""opulent and flourishing bazaars"" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was ""noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware."" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: ""other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.""  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, ""Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.""  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a ""major city"")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K.

They may even use cars these days. :-)  The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says ""Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."" Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.  >> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.

83442.eml,talk.religion.misc,"Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a ""good thing"" by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called ""The Gay Agenda"" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN ""EX-GAY"" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style"" through prayer.  ""I'd like to give the award back,"" Caligiuri now laughs, ""I'm no longer deserve it."" Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  ""There's no reality in it,"" he says, ""I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."" Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  ""We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that ""about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men."" ""Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time,"" says Lisa Seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  ""These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."" ""It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. ""But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."" Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  ""I was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again."" When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  ""He had another man there with him,"" Caligiuri recalls.  ""I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore."" Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell. Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  ""We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,"" Caligiuri says, ""so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.""  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, ""They'll do anything to reach these people."" ""David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, ""like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."" Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  ""They were relieved,"" he recalls. ""They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person."" But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  ""By the time I appeared on Sally's show,"" ""I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time."" Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.""  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other ""reformed"" homosexuals. ""I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another,"" Caligiuri says.  ""We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else."" By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie. Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  ""I was too sick to go to church,"" he explains.  ""The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."" Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  ""I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says. Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""But not with a CHristian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. ""I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says.  ""I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.""  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian ""Lazarus Project"" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""Love In Action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin"" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _""Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.  Thank you."

I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities along the coast of Finland.

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to control events.  Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results.  Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there is no room for compromise.

Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent ""ex-gay"" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as ""ineffective . . . not one person was healed.""  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed ""reparative therapy.""  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called ""The Ex-Ex-Gay"" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is ""physically"" forced to stay in this ""reparative therapy"" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some ""first-hand"" real life and loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.  Thank you. PAX"

As a supplement to them, we will merely show here in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great truth.  FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows, surely the One who knows will speak, since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who have consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.  Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be continued In$a Allah.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals.

I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is ""what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?"". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:  ""Oh, where is the sea?"", the fishes cried, As they swam its clearness through."

Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).  > >The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created >in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever >moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we >are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to >argue that God is a ""do what I say, not what I do"" kind of guy.  The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created in His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.  > >Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no >Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.  No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate"" to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

You like those conclusions? >I don't.  I think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.  In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as ""objective values.""  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will be a good beginning.  >-- >Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That' >odwyer@sse.ie                                  from ""Hens"",  by Evelyn Conlon  eric"

83467.eml,talk.religion.misc,"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the ""Family Values"" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a ""nonpolitical"", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.  In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business executive wrote: ""Separation of church and state is a false premise that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of our constitution.""

Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again?  (1)  Stephen said you took a quote out of context (2)  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article (call it A) that took a quote out of context (3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the lack of X  (a common creationist error) (4)  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A (5)  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK, or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite. (6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in A. (7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins ""Could you please explain ..."" was not a nonsequitur, but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it. (8)  Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A (9)  But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this (10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A, and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists.  Is that better Jim?   It's called an argument.  If you disagree with it, explain why the argument is not sound.  (I admit that my assumption in (7) may have been a bit hasty.)

You examine the predicitions that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.  For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created 10,000 years ago.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.  Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.   mathew"

There's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.  There's no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.  There's no objective reality.

That's how your light must shine in front of the world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your Father in the skies.

I assure you, till the sky and the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of The Law will ever go away until everthing has come to pass. So anyone who dissolves even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone great in the kingdom of the skies.""

83499.eml,talk.religion.misc,"I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media. When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist. I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear things like ""They just don't value human life like we do..."" and so on. I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just hype.  I would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail, and I'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is.  -Scott Vann buddha@iastate.edu"

83503.eml,talk.religion.misc,"The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)"

83506.eml,talk.religion.misc,"930418  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.] The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]   Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  ""In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices. Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.  ""Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  ""The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  ""Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.""  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus, Caliph of the United States of America, Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way? Will I? I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses. Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.   This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.  I am I!  Frater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII"
