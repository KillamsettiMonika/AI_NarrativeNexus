Waise usse to sb chutiya hi consider krte hai par phir pta chala ki jitne top coders hai jinki intern lgi but didn't get the PPO wo sb cheating kr rhe hai using remote access. These people are the least to be expected ki wo cheat kre. Mtlb inko bss ek company me shortlist chahiye and they will be sorted. I don't know what kind of mentality they have. And this includes mostly all people who had intern at Google, Microsoft, etc. Saare above expert hai mostly on codeforces. Ptani inko apni mehnat pr bharosa hai ya nhi that they have to cheat. Ab kuch kiya bhi nhi jaa skta kyuki day 1 is almost over. Aur ye cheating chal rhi hai iske baare me CDC/Placement cell ke members ko bhi pta hai kyuki usme bhi inhi ke dost hai. Matlab aisa hai koi kitna gir skta hai. Even if CDC me complain ki jaaye wo aage jaake company ko to batayenge nhi ki cheating hui hai kyuki clg ki reputation khrab hogi.
